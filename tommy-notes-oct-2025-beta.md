Right now the initial task is to figure out where my current progress is. I gave a task to AI to help me pull out all the gems from my two different mold shells and I think it was able to pull generations one through 19. Can you help me double check if it pulled it correctly? I just need to know that the original gems were created correctly compared to molt shell baselines. I understand that there might be some slight differences but it should be 95% parity. Please give me a. Report of what is the current status and checklist. Inside the root folder. Called HFO. Gem review.Timestamp.  MD. I just want to know where we are. Umm so each. Subfolder should have actually three files inside original gem, summary and a deep dive. I can see it. I know that we are not at full completion, but I don't want to manually check everything, so just give me a heads up of sort of where we're currently at and what do you recommend our next step is? It really seems like the AI is constantly failing at this task. I've given it for multiple attempts and I am not sure even why it's failing to do this. Is it due to the long contacts window? Like I'm not even sure that's it's weird.

i need help setting up the swarmlord of webs for kilo code, can you search for the swarmlord of webs in my hfo gem folder and see his iterations. the goal is a facade pattern I can use to solve some fothe biggest @/hfo_research_doc/current-gen-ai-weakness-analysis-ictober-25-2025.md  and look at how kilo code has roles set up, for example kilo code orchestrator is in @/hfo-swarmlord-of-webs-kilo-code-mode-2025-10-27T21-32-26Z/kilo-code-orchestrator-20252027.md so swarmlord shoul dbe the kilo code orchestrator and more my strategic c2 facade that helps solve my ai problems

to swarmlord of webs
you are my agent you need to do all these things for me. keep me ay the vision and strategic level, you are focused on the tactical and execution

please take a look at my hfo gem folder, I am trying to create gem gen 21 but there is so much hallucination and regression. can you consier gem gen 19 as something that looks 80% correct and help me align and create a new grok 4 fast attemp 1 gem md int he gen 21 sub folder. it should be between 1000~1500 lines and contains the most important pieces. please consider the @/hfo_gem/gen_1_evolution_19/evolution_analysis.md as well

Swim lane with user swarm, loader, webs, PREY, Workflow Independent. Verifier. So the idea would be the user gives intent to the swarm board of webs. The swarm board of webs clarifies through a few prompts if the mission intent is new. If the mission intent is already available as a YAML file with the timestamp for today, for example, then it could just be a quick confirmation pass. But if it's a new mission intent then it should be at least 3 clarification passes. Before a mission, intense YAML is created. Then we work through the PREY workflow which should be mapped to JADC 2 cents. Makes sense act. And feedback system which is the yield. Once we had the yield available right, we should have an independent verifier. Check that the yield is correct. There's no obvious answers. And once that's OK, that payload gets sent over to the swarm world of webs for a final review. Once the swarm loader web reviews it looks good, then it's gonna go and give me a payload digest which will be in the format that I already have, which would be something like BLUF matrix diagram and some notes for me. The idea is that it could keep me cognitively focused on the vision strategic level, while the swarm lord of webs helps me handle all the subworkers, all the different execution and tactical level stuff. I had this vision in my mind and I think I already had pieces of it, but what's happening is that I'm not doing this in the workflow of High Fleet Obsidian, and there's a lot of babysitting still. I'm gonna go and include. Some of the Swarm Lord of Web's Kilo code mode as well. The one I want you to look at is version 19 and version 15. Version 15 seems to work, but there's a lot of babysitting, like too many manual pieces, and version 19 is the evolution of that. But I'm pretty sure the version 19 is not working correctly. There's a lot of hallucination. So I would need to redo it, but I'm thinking of. Doing a HFO gem generation 21. A new attempt, maybe we could have it called be GPT5 attempt three. And then once we have that, it should then regenerate outwards and create the swarm Lord of Webs Kilo code mode version 20.

vector to victory
in state action space
the vector to get to the goal
maybe slight changes
but which direction?  in which axis?
---
systems thinking
changing identity that is pretty upstream and high leverage
possibly more than goals
to change the perspective
the identity
who and what the self is
from individual to a group or vice versa
