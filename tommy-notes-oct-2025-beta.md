Right now the initial task is to figure out where my current progress is. I gave a task to AI to help me pull out all the gems from my two different mold shells and I think it was able to pull generations one through 19. Can you help me double check if it pulled it correctly? I just need to know that the original gems were created correctly compared to molt shell baselines. I understand that there might be some slight differences but it should be 95% parity. Please give me a. Report of what is the current status and checklist. Inside the root folder. Called HFO. Gem review.Timestamp.  MD. I just want to know where we are. Umm so each. Subfolder should have actually three files inside original gem, summary and a deep dive. I can see it. I know that we are not at full completion, but I don't want to manually check everything, so just give me a heads up of sort of where we're currently at and what do you recommend our next step is? It really seems like the AI is constantly failing at this task. I've given it for multiple attempts and I am not sure even why it's failing to do this. Is it due to the long contacts window? Like I'm not even sure that's it's weird.
