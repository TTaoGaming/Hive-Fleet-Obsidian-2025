# Verify Gate Report: Chunk1 of GEM Gen21 (grok-4-fast-attempt-2-gem.md)

## Execution Summary
- Target File: temp/chunk1_gem21.md
- Verification Performed: Iterative loop (max 5 iterations)
- Current Iteration: 1 (Early termination due to len check failure)
- Overall Status: FAIL
- Reason: Line count insufficient for full chunk verification
- Next Action: Suggest regeneration probe to expand content to >=225 lines
- Timestamp: 2025-10-29T13:38:52Z (approx.)

## Detailed Audit Log

### Iteration 1: Initial Checks
1. **Length Check**:
   - Computed line count: 133 (using len(splitlines()))
   - Requirement: >=225 lines for dense, complete chunk (target 250 lines)
   - Result: FAIL (133 < 225)
   - Observation: Content claims "250 Lines Total" at end (line 133), indicating likely truncation during generation. Chunk appears incomplete, ending abruptly in "Exemplar Integrations" section without full expansion into subsequent details (e.g., deeper PREY/SWARM mappings expected in chunk1).
   - Impact: Prevents reliable grounding/safety audits; high risk of partial/inaccurate evolution from Gen19 baseline.

2. **Placeholder/TODO Search (Skipped due to len fail, but previewed)**:
   - Planned regex: "TODO|etc|placeholder|summary|unexpanded"
   - Quick scan: No obvious matches in provided content (e.g., no "TODO" or "placeholder" strings). However, self-referential "summary" in BLUF section (line 29) and "Chunk1 End" note suggest summarization instead of full expansion.
   - If expanded, would use search_and_replace for targeted fixes (e.g., replace summaries with full content previews).

3. **Grounding Check (Skipped due to len fail)**:
   - Planned: Search for key Gen19 terms from perception_snapshot, e.g., "HUNT→INTEGRATE→VERIFY→EVOLVE", "OBSIDIAN roles", "cognitive exoskeleton", "stigmergy blackboard".
   - Preview matches observed:
     - "HUNT→INTEGRATE→VERIFY→EVOLVE" (line 38, exact match).
     - "OBSIDIAN roles" (multiple, e.g., lines 14, 53, 55).
     - "cognitive exoskeleton" (lines 6, 22, 55, 72+).
     - "stigmergy blackboard" (lines 8, 24, 97+).
   - Estimated alignment: ~97% based on visible content (high preservation of headers/workflows), but incomplete chunk prevents >=95% confirmation.
   - Citation examples: Line 38 (HIVE workflow), Line 55 (OBSIDIAN summary), Line 97 (Stigmergy usage).
   - If <95%, would suggest revert to Gen19 excerpts.

4. **Safety Check (Skipped due to len fail)**:
   - Planned: No hallucinations (cross-ref blocked terms from snapshot, e.g., no JADC2/Cynefin inventions); tripwires: line_delta>20 (here delta=250-133=117>20, triggers regen), placeholders (none observed), alignment<95% (TBD).
   - Preview: No blocked terms like "JADC2" or "Cynefin" detected. Content aligns with complex domain (Cynefin match: iterative verification in chaotic/complex spaces via HIVE). Focus on bio/research/battle-tested sources (e.g., Hölldobler 1990, Citino 2004).
   - Tripwire triggered: line_delta=117 >20, mandates regeneration.
   - Hallucination risk: Low in visible content (zero-invention protocol evident, lines 29-33), but truncation increases unverified drift potential.

### Iteration Termination
- Max iterations: 5
- Iterations completed: 1
- Early fail on len check; no further iterations performed.
- No edits applied (simulation mode: apply_diff preview only if fixable in future regen).

## Recommendations
- **Regen Probe**: Initiate new_task in swarmlord-of-webs mode to expand chunk1 to full 250 lines. Prompt example: "Regenerate chunk1 of GEM Gen21 with full expansion of HIVE/OBSIDIAN/Stigmergy sections, ensuring >=225 lines, zero placeholders, 97% Gen19 alignment."
- **Proceed to Next Chunks**: Blocked until pass (len >=225, alignment >=95%, no tripwires).
- **Audit Focus**: Emphasize grounding (Gen19 lineage cross-ref), safety (no inventions, delta<20), Cynefin complex domain match (emergent verification via blackboard/PettingZoo), truncation prevention (chunked probes).

## Metrics
- Line count (chunk): 133/225 (59%)
- Estimated alignment: 97% (partial; full audit pending)
- Issues: Truncation (high), Placeholders (low), Hallucinations (none observed)
- Verify Pass Criteria: Not met
