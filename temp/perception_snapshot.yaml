        - Protocol: 1. Append-Only: Immutable audit (biological memory); 2. TTL Evaporation: Freshness like pheromones (synaptic decay); 3. Role Handoffs: Cognitive routing (next_role for exoskeleton flow); 4. Query Before Claim: Verify external state (no optimism, neuro checks)
        - Message Format: {"timestamp": "2025-10-25T00:00:00Z", "role": "assimilator", "next_role": "navigator", "event_type": "PREY_yield_reflect", "data": {"lineage": "past_pattern", "plasticity_score": 0.8}, "ttl": 3600}

  blocked_capabilities:
    - hallucinations_gen21_trail: Swarmlord v15.2 lvl0 disables PettingZoo ground truth temporarily replaced by file/diff/blackboard verification (deviates from Gen19 V>H PettingZoo ≥90% mandatory; risks unverified coordination claims; prioritizes cold-start over empirical validation)
    - hallucinations_gen21_cold_start: Remaps PREY to insert_content without Gen19 alignment; introduces Cynefin classification not in Gen19 HIVE; SIEGCSE roles partially match but adds Sustainers/Evaluators without cognitive ties; blackboard format lacks Gen19 cognitive fields (plasticity_score, next_role); mission_intent adds toggles/health_floor_check but omits Red Sand explicit; Verify Gate ≥2 evidences aligns but no PettingZoo; potential drift in zero-invention (new templates/scripts without exemplar mapping)
