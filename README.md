# HiveFleetObsidian Project

## Purpose
HiveFleetObsidian is a research and development project focused on evolutionary AI systems, gem generation, audits, and baseline testing for MOLT shell simulations. It explores concepts like gene seeds, strategic synthesis, and swarm strategies in a structured, timestamped workflow.

## Structure
- **HFO_molt_shell_2025-10-25T16:24:00Z/**: Contains earlier pass data including audits_reports, baselines_results, core_scripts, gems (with duplicates and generations), summaries_docs, and todo/notes.
- **HFO_molt_shell_2025-10-25T17:00:00Z/**: Contains later pass data including audits_reports, baselines_results, core_scripts, summaries_docs, and handoff documents.

This setup enables tracking of project evolution across timestamps.
