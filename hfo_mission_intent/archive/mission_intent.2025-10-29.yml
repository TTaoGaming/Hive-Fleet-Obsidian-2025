goal: Merge and standardize all hfo_mission_intent/archive/mission_intent*.yml files into one master template with common structure (goal, constraints, success_criteria, safety) to enable one-per-day usage going forward.

constraints:
  - Standardize keys to exact format: goal (string), constraints (list), success_criteria (list), safety (object with tripwires, canary_plan, revert_plan)
  - Ignore non-matching files (e.g., non-YAML or missing required keys)

success_criteria:
  - 100% coverage of unique content from all .yml files in archive/
  - Master file parses as valid YAML
  - Documented merge log in comments

safety:
  tripwires:
    - Halt if data loss detected (e.g., diff shows missing unique elements)
  canary_plan:
    - Validate draft on 20% of files first; limit to read-only analysis
  revert_plan:
    - No changes to originals; delete draft master if invalid; restore from archive backups
