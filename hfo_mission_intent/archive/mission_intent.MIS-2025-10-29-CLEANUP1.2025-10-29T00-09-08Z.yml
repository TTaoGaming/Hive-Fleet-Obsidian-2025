goal: Clean up all mission_intent*.yml files by adding timestamps to filenames (format: mission_intent.<mission_id>.<RFC3339>.yml) and moving them into a new/ existing 'mission_intent/' folder from wherever they are scattered.
constraints:
  - Do not modify file contents
  - create 'mission_intent/' if missing
  - rename using creation/mod time if no mission_id
  - exclude non-yml files
success_criteria:
  - Folder contains all renamed files
  - mission_intent.latest.yml points to newest
  - git status shows only adds/moves, no deletes
safety:
  tripwires:
    - Any file content mismatch post-move (checksum fail)
    - >10 files processed without pause
  canary_plan:
    - Rename/move one file, verify manually
  revert_plan:
    - Git checkout originals
    - delete new folder if needed
