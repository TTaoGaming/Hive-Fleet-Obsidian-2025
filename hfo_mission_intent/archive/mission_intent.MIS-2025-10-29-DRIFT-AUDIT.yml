goal: Audit and correct past mission intent drifts in current missions within swarmlord-of-webs mode files, and implement enforced versioning checks to prevent future drifts.

constraints:
  - Maximum effort: 1 hour total
  - Scope limited to swarmlord-of-webs mode files only (e.g., archive directories like hfo-swarmlord-of-webs-kilo-code-mode-2025-10-27T21-32-26Z/archive/)

success_criteria:
  - All identified past drifts in current missions corrected with versioned mission_intent.yml files
  - Enforced checks (e.g., via blackboard appends or mode instructions) in place to ensure no future silent drifts occur

safety:
  tripwires:
    - Scope exceed: Stop immediately if any non-swarmlord-of-webs mode file is touched or if total effort approaches 1 hour without completion
  canary_plan: Apply all audits and changes exclusively to archive files first (e.g., hfo-swarmlord-of-webs-kilo-code-mode-2025-10-27T21-32-26Z/archive/) to limit blast radius
  revert_plan: Manually delete any new or modified files created during this mission within 1 hour; restore from existing backups if available (e.g., blackboard/deduplicated_blackboard_backup_20251027.jsonl)
