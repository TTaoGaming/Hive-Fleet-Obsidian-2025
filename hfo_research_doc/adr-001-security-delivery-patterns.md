# ADR-001: Adopt Industry-Standard Security and Delivery Patterns for HFO

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2025-10-30

## Context

Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) currently lacks formalized security gates, progressive delivery mechanisms, and LLM-specific safety controls. This creates risk of:
- Compounded hallucinations reaching production
- Large blast radius from unsafe code changes
- Insufficient audit trail for agent actions
- No automated rollback on detected issues

The problem statement requests integration of proven industry patterns to reduce these risks through:
- Hard gates that prevent unsafe code from merging
- Canary deployments with automated rollback
- Feature flags for controlled rollout
- Policy-as-code enforcement
- Static analysis and supply chain verification

## Decision

We will adopt a phased integration of 9 industry-standard patterns, mapped to HFO's PREY workflow:

### Patterns to Adopt

1. **Code Review + Small Diffs** (Google Engineering Practices)
   - Enforce ≤200 line chunk size via CI
   - Require human approval before merge
   
2. **Progressive Delivery** (Argo Rollouts)
   - All risky deployments use canary strategy
   - Auto-rollback on SLO breach
   
3. **Feature Flags** (OpenFeature CNCF standard)
   - Wrap new/risky code paths
   - Default OFF, gradual rollout
   
4. **Policy-as-Code Gates** (OPA/Conftest)
   - Block PRs missing: tests, flags, ownership, blackboard receipts
   - Enforce chunk size and placeholder bans
   
5. **Static Analysis** (CodeQL + Semgrep)
   - Required security scanning on every PR
   - Custom rules for HFO-specific patterns
   
6. **Supply-Chain Integrity** (SLSA + Cosign)
   - Generate provenance attestations
   - Sign all artifacts before deployment
   
7. **Observability** (OpenTelemetry)
   - Instrument all PREY phases
   - Track DORA Four Keys metrics
   
8. **Docs-as-Code** (Backstage TechDocs + Diátaxis)
   - Require ADR for major decisions
   - Organize as: tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation
   
9. **LLM-Specific Safety** (OWASP LLM Top 10 + NIST AI RMF)
   - Runtime guards for prompt injection, excessive agency
   - Policy rules for tool execution approval

### PREY Workflow Integration

- **Perceive**: Load OPA policies, run CodeQL/Semgrep scans
- **React**: Plan chunks ≤200 lines, define feature flags, set tripwires
- **Engage**: Wrap code in flags, apply LLM safety guards, run local tests
- **Yield**: Generate SLSA attestation, sign with Cosign, deploy canary, monitor OpenTelemetry metrics
- **Verify**: Independent check of signatures, policy compliance, security scans
- **Digest**: Append blackboard receipt, update TechDocs, record DORA metrics

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1-2)
- GitHub branch protection with required checks
- CodeQL and Semgrep workflows
- Basic OPA policies (chunk size, tests required)
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation

**Phase 2: Progressive Delivery** (Week 3-4)
- OpenFeature SDK integration
- Argo Rollouts configuration
- AnalysisTemplates for auto-rollback
- Canary process documentation

**Phase 3: Supply Chain** (Week 5-6)
- SLSA provenance in CI
- Cosign signing setup
- Signature verification in deploy
- SBOM generation

**Phase 4: LLM Safety** (Week 7-8)
- OWASP LLM Top 10 controls
- OPA policies for agent actions
- Runtime safety guards
- Hallucination detection metrics

**Phase 5: Documentation** (Week 9-10)
- Backstage TechDocs setup
- Diátaxis structure organization
- ADR templates and process
- Automated doc generation

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reduced Hallucination Risk**: Hard gates block unsafe code before human review
- **Constrained Blast Radius**: Canaries limit impact to 5-20% of traffic initially
- **Automated Recovery**: Rollback on bad metrics without human intervention
- **Audit Trail**: Signed provenance and blackboard receipts provide evidence chain
- **Quality Improvement**: DORA metrics track deployment frequency, lead time, failure rate, recovery time
- **Agent Substrate**: Docs-as-code gives agents stable, verified knowledge base

### Negative

- **Initial Setup Cost**: 10 weeks to full implementation
- **CI Time Increase**: Static analysis and policy checks add 2-5 minutes per PR
- **Learning Curve**: Team must learn OPA, Argo Rollouts, OpenFeature, SLSA
- **Tool Complexity**: 9 new tools in the stack (OPA, CodeQL, Semgrep, OpenFeature, Argo, Cosign, OpenTelemetry, Backstage, OWASP controls)

### Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: False positives from static analysis slow development
- Mitigation: Start with warning-only mode, tune rules iteratively, allow override with justification

**Risk**: Canary deployments fail to detect issues before promotion
- Mitigation: Define comprehensive AnalysisTemplates covering error rate, latency, resource usage; require minimum 5-minute observation window

**Risk**: Feature flags accumulate and become technical debt
- Mitigation: Track flag age in metrics, require removal plan in ADR, auto-alert on flags >30 days old

**Risk**: Team bypasses gates under pressure
- Mitigation: Enforce branch protection at GitHub level, require admin approval for exemptions, log all bypasses

### Cold Start Path Verification

The 5-phase roadmap follows proven patterns:
- **Foundation first**: Matches GitHub's security-first approach (branch protection before features)
- **Progressive delivery second**: Aligns with Google SRE "launch coordination" chapter ordering
- **Supply chain third**: Follows SLSA level progression (source→build→provenance)
- **LLM safety fourth**: Builds on foundation (needs policies + telemetry in place)
- **Documentation last**: Captures accumulated knowledge (Diátaxis: explanation comes after how-to)

### Potential Hallucinations Identified and Corrected

**Claim**: "Netflix uses OPA broadly for unified policy"
- **Verification**: Confirmed at openpolicyagent.org/integrations and Netflix TechBlog
- **Status**: ✓ Verified

**Claim**: "Used by teams at Netflix and AWS" (for Jenkins)
- **Verification**: Jenkins site confirms Netflix contribution, AWS uses Jenkins per aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/
- **Status**: ✓ Verified

**Claim**: "Canary analysis queries read from this [OpenTelemetry]"
- **Verification**: Argo Rollouts AnalysisTemplate supports Prometheus (OTel target) per argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/analysis/
- **Status**: ✓ Verified, implementation detail accurate

**Claim**: "Use Diátaxis to force structure"
- **Verification**: Diátaxis is a framework, not enforcement tool; rewording needed
- **Status**: ⚠️ Imprecise language - "use Diátaxis framework to organize" is more accurate

**Claim**: "GitHub Actions can emit attestations you can check"
- **Verification**: Confirmed at slsa.dev and github.blog/2023-05-02-introducing-npm-package-provenance/
- **Status**: ✓ Verified

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Build Custom Solutions
- **Rejected**: Higher maintenance burden, reinventing well-tested patterns, no community support

### Alternative 2: Adopt Fewer Patterns (e.g., just CodeQL + feature flags)
- **Rejected**: Partial coverage leaves gaps; need defense-in-depth for compounded hallucination risk

### Alternative 3: Use Vendor-Specific Tools (LaunchDarkly, Datadog, etc.)
- **Rejected**: Lock-in risk; prefer open standards (OpenFeature, OpenTelemetry) with vendor flexibility

### Alternative 4: Implement All at Once
- **Rejected**: Too much change at once; phased approach allows learning and adjustment
