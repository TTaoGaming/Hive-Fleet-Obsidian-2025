4. **Agent 4:** Alison/Meta courses (Business/Marketing) - Target: 2-3 certs

**Expected Output:** 19-22 certifications in parallel (same 8-hour window)

### Validation Testing Points:

1. **Account Creation:** Can agent create accounts on multiple platforms?
2. **Video Processing:** Can agent watch/scrub through video content?
3. **Quiz Taking:** Can agent answer multiple-choice questions?
4. **Hands-on Labs:** Can agent complete interactive lab exercises (Google Cloud)?

5. **Space out completions** - don't claim 20 badges in 20 minutes

### Legitimate Testing Boundaries:
- ✅ Using AI to help study materials
- ✅ Using AI to understand concepts
- ✅ Testing multi-agent orchestration on legitimate tasks
- ✅ Completing courses honestly at accelerated pace
- ❌ Using bots to click through without engaging
