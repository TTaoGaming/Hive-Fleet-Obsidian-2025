## Detailed Sections

### Category 1: Hallucinations

Hallucinations represent AI-generated inaccuracies that accumulate faster than human verification, leading to system instability.

#### Pain Point 1: Optimistic AI Causing Hallucinogenic Death Spirals
**Description:** AI optimism bias leads to overconfident outputs, creating positive feedback loops where errors amplify.
**Examples from Repo:** In Gem1_Pass10, 6 prototypes failed due to unchecked hallucinations (e.g., 50k-line HTML became spaghetti).
**Root Causes:** Lack of V > H ratio; manual verification bottleneck (100-200 lines/min vs. AI's 31k/day).
**Proposed Mitigations:** Implement RAG with semantic embeddings to enforce ground truth.
**Implementation Ideas:** Use LangChain for RAG: `from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA; qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())`. Tools: FAISS for embeddings.

#### Pain Point 2: Lack of Ground Truth Verification
**Description:** Absence of external validation allows fabricated information to persist.
**Examples from Repo:** Gen19 audit showed <2% hallucination divergence, but without checks, it compounds (e.g., MediaPipe reinvention).
**Root Causes:** No stigmergic blackboard for state persistence.
**Proposed Mitigations:** Chain-of-Thought prompting to break down reasoning.
**Implementation Ideas:** CoT prompt template: "Step 1: Identify facts. Step 2: Verify against repo. Step 3: Generate output." Code snippet: `prompt = PromptTemplate(template=CoT_template, input_variables=["query"])`. Tools: LangChain.

#### Pain Point 3: Jagged AI Performance
**Description:** AI excels in areas but hallucinates inconsistently, breaking workflows.

**Proposed Mitigations:** Stigmergy for indirect coordination and error correction.
