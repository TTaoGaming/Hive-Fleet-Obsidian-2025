## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES

### ToS Compliance Strategy
‚úÖ **ALLOWED - These are Learning Platforms:**
- Taking courses and assessments as designed
- Completing quizzes and tests
- Earning completion certificates
- Using educational platforms for their intended purpose

‚ö†Ô∏è **GRAY AREA - Use Caution:**
- Automated form filling (like browser automation)
- Taking multiple courses simultaneously
- Completing courses faster than typical humans

‚ùå **AVOID:**
- Platforms with explicit "human only" requirements
- Exams with webcam proctoring
- Platforms with anti-bot detection
- Misrepresenting yourself

### Reality Check
**What You're Testing:**
- Can your AI system comprehend course material?
- Can it answer assessment questions correctly?
- Can it complete coding challenges?
- Can it navigate web interfaces?

**What You're NOT Doing:**
- Claiming professional credentials fraudulently
- Using certificates for employment
- Bypassing identity verification
- Violating platform terms of service

**Ethical Framework:**
This is a **capability test** of your AI system, similar to:
- Running benchmark tests on hardware
- Testing software against standard datasets
- Academic research on AI capabilities
- Educational use of online resources
