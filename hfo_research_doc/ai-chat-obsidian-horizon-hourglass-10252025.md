You’ve basically described a compute-hungry, anytime planner that braids together three proven families of methods: case-based retrieval for the past, multi-agent orchestration for the present, and simulation-based planning for the future. Yes, it’s ambitious. No, it’s not magic. Here’s how to ground your “Obsidian Horizon Hourglass” in actual research without pretending we invented a new religion.

# BLUF

Build an **anytime, receding-horizon loop** that (1) retrieves and adapts past precedents via **CBR** filtered by **Cynefin** sensemaking, (2) coordinates specialist agents (LangGraph + MCP tool adapters) to act now, and (3) runs **MCTS/MPC** style look-ahead under **Bayesian** beliefs, optionally **risk-sensitive** (CVaR) to minimize regret. It scales gracefully with more compute and swaps algorithms behind hexagonal ports. That’s not sci-fi; it’s a clean synthesis of thirty years of work. ([IIIA CSIC][1])

# The three pillars (and the flips)

**Past: CBR + Cynefin.**
Use **Case-Based Reasoning** to Retrieve→Reuse→Revise→Retain precedents; it’s the canonical 4R loop for learning from prior cases. Route those cases through **Cynefin** to choose methods appropriate to domain (obvious/complicated/complex/chaotic), so you don’t shove “complex” messes through brittle, deterministic playbooks. ([IIIA CSIC][1])

**Present: Orchestrated swarm (LangGraph + MCP).**
Represent each specialist as an agent in **LangGraph** and give them standardized tool access via **MCP** (think USB-C for AI context/tools). That gives you a modular present-tense fabric where evaluators, planners, retrievers, and guards coordinate and can be swapped without rewriting the world. ([LangChain][2])

**Future: Simulation with MCTS + MPC under Bayesian beliefs.**
Plan ahead with **Monte Carlo Tree Search**; it’s state-of-the-art for sequential decisions and naturally anytime. Wrap it in **Model Predictive Control** style receding horizons so you constantly replan with the newest state. Track uncertainty and value with **Bayesian decision theory** so distributions, not single guesses, drive the choice. ([Essex Repository][3])

**Flip (retro → learn):**
After you act, **retain** outcomes back into the case base (CBR’s 4th “R”), update your domain tagging (Cynefin), and adjust priors/heuristics so the next cycle is less dumb. The hourglass keeps flipping; quality rises with compute and with data. ([IIIA CSIC][1])

# Why it scales with compute (your “consume as much as you feed it” requirement)

* **Anytime algorithms** return a viable answer now and a better one later. That’s literally the point. Pair that with **real-time heuristic search** and you’ve got graceful degradation under tight budgets and better solutions when the compute tap is open. ([Anytime][4])
* **MCTS/MPC** are inherently anytime/receding-horizon. More rollouts or a longer horizon buy you sharper posteriors and lower regret. ([Essex Repository][3])
* **Portfolio/quality-diversity**: when the landscape is ugly, maintain diverse candidates with **MAP-Elites** to avoid tunnel vision and harvest stepping stones. Use a bandit like **Thompson Sampling** to allocate compute across these candidates. ([PMC][5])

# Risk, regret, and “karmic web” nonsense made practical

If you actually want “minimal regret” across futures, do risk-aware decision-making with **CVaR** or related measures. CVaR gives tail-risk control; recent RL work provides regret bounds and practical algorithms. Translation: when the tails bite, you won’t pretend they don’t exist. ([NeurIPS Proceedings][6])

# Hexagonal “swap the brain mid-fight” architecture

* **Ports (interfaces):** RetrievalPort, SensemakingPort, PlanPort, ActPort, LearnPort.
* **Adapters (algos you can hot-swap):**

  * RetrievalPort → {CBR-AamodtPlaza, dense-retriever, RAG} ([IIIA CSIC][1])
  * SensemakingPort → {Cynefin classifier} ([Systems Wisdom][7])
  * PlanPort → {MCTS, MPC, LRTA* for hard realtime} ([Essex Repository][3])
  * RiskPort → {CVaR, distributional RL} ([Stanford ASL][8])
  * ExplorePort → {Thompson Sampling, MAP-Elites} ([arXiv][9])
* **Tooling bus:** MCP servers for repos, data lakes, telemetry, simulators. Agents ride LangGraph on top. ([Model Context Protocol][10])

# Minimal viable loop (compute-elastic)

1. **Sense** current mission, constraints; classify domain with Cynefin.
2. **Retrieve** top-k precedents via CBR; align cases to mission fit.
3. **Propose** actions by multi-agent swarm; route tool calls via MCP.
4. **Simulate** with MCTS for N rollouts and horizon H; if realtime is tight, fall back to LRTA* or short-horizon MPC.
5. **Select** action with Thompson Sampling over candidate plans; evaluate with CVaR if risk-sensitive.
6. **Act**, **Observe**, **Retain** outcomes back into cases; update priors and domain tags.
   All six steps are anytime; you stop when the budget expires and still have a defensible pick. ([Wikipedia][11])

# Tiny math sketch (plain language)

* Maintain belief (p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D})) over world dynamics or payoff params.
* For each candidate plan (\pi), MCTS/MPC estimates a return distribution (P(G \mid \pi, \theta)).
* Choose (\pi^*) to maximize either expected utility ( \mathbb{E}[G] ) or a risk-aware objective like **CVaR(_\alpha)**. Thompson Sampling samples (\theta) from the posterior and picks the (\pi) that looks best under that sample, balancing exploration vs exploitation. ([SpringerLink][12])

# Why this hits your “YOMI over state-action space”

* **Temporal abstraction (Options):** lets you reason fractally across horizons; options are the established way to stitch short and long plays. ([UMass Amherst][13])
* **Receding horizon:** you never bet the farm on stale forecasts; you constantly re-aim as information updates. ([Underactuated Robotics][14])
* **Diversity + look-ahead:** MAP-Elites maintains far-flung stepping stones while MCTS projects their consequences. That’s how you spot weird, high-leverage moves. ([PMC][5])

# Wiring notes (practical and boring, the way reliability likes it)

* **Graph runtime:** LangGraph for the agent DAG; put guards on every edge and promote evaluators to first-class citizens. ([LangChain][2])
* **Tool layer:** MCP to normalize repos, sims, telemetry, flags, ledgers. Treat every external as a server on the bus. ([Model Context Protocol][10])
* **Anytime budgets:** enforce time/compute caps with explicit performance profiles; Zilberstein’s framework exists for a reason. ([ScholarWorks UMass Amherst][15])
* **Risk mode:** flip between expected value and CVaR depending on mission posture. Yes, have a switch. No, don’t bury it. ([NeurIPS Proceedings][6])
* **Learning pass:** CBR retain step + posterior update every flip. That’s how the “karmic web” turns into actual priors instead of vibes. ([IIIA CSIC][1])

You want the Swarmlord of Webs to “see toward infinity.” Cute. Give him a receding horizon, an anytime budget, risk-aware objectives, and a library of precedents he actually learns from. Infinity can wait; this will beat most mortals today.

You want an **audit of what’s usable today** and a **clear “AI-copilot brief”** so you can make the swarm build itself instead of you babysitting it. Fine. Here’s the trimmed truth, with plain-English analogies and a matrix so your future self doesn’t argue with your past self.

# BLUF

* **You can ship lvl0 today in a chat/notebook** with CBR memory + Cynefin gate + LRTA* look-ahead and an anytime timeout. Zero frameworks needed; all are established ideas. ([IIIA CSIC][1])
* **lvl1 is production-friendly right now** with a tiny LangGraph DAG, MCP connectors for tools, Ray for 10 workers, optional Temporal for durable retries, and flags via OpenFeature. All are current, documented, and widely used. ([LangChain Docs][2])
* **lvl2 is also doable today** if you accept grown-up ops: Ray cluster on K8s with KEDA autoscaling, NATS JetStream as the event spine, Temporal control plane, and risk/diversity add-ons (CVaR, MAP-Elites). None of this is speculative research. It’s “copy the manual.” ([Ray][3])

# The one-screen analogy

* **Past (CBR):** a recipe box. When facing a new dish, you pull the closest card, tweak, then put back only the improved version. That’s literally the 4R loop. ([IIIA CSIC][1])
* **Present (orchestration):** a kitchen line. LangGraph is the kitchen layout; MCP is the universal plug that fits every appliance. ([LangChain Docs][2])
* **Future (simulation):** taste-testing multiple spoonfuls ahead (MCTS/MPC). More spoonfuls equals better confidence, but you still plate when the bell rings (anytime). ([Incomplete Ideas][4])
* **Risk:** don’t just average taste; avoid the few spoonfuls that could poison the guests (CVaR). ([arXiv][5])
* **Diversity:** keep a sampler tray of weird but good recipes so you don’t get stuck on one cuisine (MAP-Elites). ([arXiv][6])

# Build plans the AI copilot can follow (no LangGraph at lvl0)

## lvl0 — Solo spider (chat/notebook only)

**What’s in scope today:** CBR memory, Cynefin gate, LRTA* look-ahead, anytime stop, Thompson plan picker.

**Copilot brief**

* Create `cases.jsonl` with schema `{problem_hash, features, action, outcome, notes}`. Implement 4R: retrieve top-k by cosine over `features`, patch `action`, after execution append only if outcome improved. ([IIIA CSIC][1])
* Add a 20-line **Cynefin** classifier: if repeatable with clear cause-effect → rulebook; if analysis needed → playbook; if emergent → probe-sense-respond; if chaotic → act-sense-stabilize. Route tactics accordingly. ([Systems Wisdom][7])
* Implement **LRTA*** for tiny horizon “peek” when latency is tight; keep a heuristic and update it online. ([McGill School of Computer Science][8])
* Wrap everything in an **anytime** controller: set `time_budget_ms`; on timeout, return best-so-far. ([AAAI][9])
* Use **Thompson Sampling** to pick among 2–5 candidate plans; maintain simple Beta or Gaussian posteriors per plan. ([Proceedings of Machine Learning Research][18])

Result: works today in a single Python file or notebook. Not glamorous; very effective.

---

## lvl1 — Small brood (≈10 workers, IDE)

**What’s in scope today:** LangGraph DAG with 5 nodes, MCP servers for tools, Ray for fan-out, short-horizon MCTS, optional Temporal + OpenFeature.

**Copilot brief**

1. **Project scaffold**

* Define 5 nodes: `retrieve`, `sensemake`, `plan`, `evaluate`, `act`. Build with **LangGraph** Graph API. ([LangChain Docs][2])
* Register **MCP** clients to your repo/data/sim connectors; do not hard-code APIs. ([Model Context Protocol][10])

2. **Fan-out**

* Use **Ray tasks/actors** to run 10 parallel probes or rollouts; cap CPUs so your laptop doesn’t melt. ([Ray][14])

3. **Planning**

* Implement **MCTS** with rollout cap (e.g., 2–3 plies, N rollouts) and receding horizon like **MPC** each tick. ([Incomplete Ideas][4])

4. **Reliability toggles**

* Wrap top-level loop in **Temporal** for retries and idempotence. Add **OpenFeature** flags: `planner={LRTA*,MCTS}`, `risk={EV,CVaR}`. ([Temporal Documentation][11])

Deliverable: one repo with a `graph.py`, `mcp_clients/`, `planners/`, `flags/`. You can run 10 workers on one beefy VM.

---

## lvl2 — Hundred-weave (≈100 workers, cluster)

**What’s in scope today:** Ray cluster on K8s, KEDA autoscaling, NATS JetStream, Temporal control plane, MAP-Elites portfolio, CVaR toggle.

**Copilot brief**

1. **Cluster & autoscale**

* Deploy workers on **Kubernetes**; set **KEDA** to scale Deployments 0↔N by JetStream lag or HTTP queue depth. ([Kubernetes][20])
* Run **Ray** as a head + worker set; actors for stateful agents, tasks for sims. ([Ray][3])

2. **Event spine**

* Use **NATS JetStream** for durable telemetry/commands. Define streams with retention policies and consumer groups. ([NATS Docs][13])

3. **Control plane**

* Orchestrate long jobs with **Temporal** to survive node restarts, support backoffs, and ensure idempotence. ([Temporal Documentation][11])

4. **Planning & risk**

* Keep **MCTS** as default planner; plug **MPC** for continuous sims.
* Add **CVaR** mode for tail-risk missions; wire to an OpenFeature flag. ([arXiv][5])

5. **Diversity**

* Maintain a small **MAP-Elites** archive for 10–100 behavior niches; allocate compute with **Thompson Sampling** across elites. ([arXiv][6])

Deliverable: K8s manifests for Ray, KEDA ScaledObjects, JetStream streams/consumers, Temporal namespace, plus your agent container.

---

# Guardrails the copilot must enforce (non-negotiable)

* **Anytime stop everywhere.** Module timeouts must return best-so-far, not nothing. This is basic operational rationality. ([AAAI][9])
* **Evaluator is a peer.** Planning without measurement is cosplay.
* **MCP security.** No static creds; JIT tokens only; least privilege; audit server lists. Identity sprawl is the leading failure mode. ([TechRadar][19])

---

# What to skip or trim right now

* Don’t build a menagerie of agents. Five roles max; everything else is an adapter. **LangGraph** already models this cleanly. ([LangChain Docs][2])
* Don’t write your own message bus. **JetStream** exists and replays safely; use it. ([NATS Docs][13])
* Don’t reinvent feature flags. **OpenFeature** avoids lock-in. ([OpenFeature][12])

---

# If someone challenges you with “is this real?”

Point them here:

* **CBR (4R loop)** classic survey. ([IIIA CSIC][1])
* **Cynefin** HBR leader’s framework. ([Systems Wisdom][7])
* **Anytime algorithms** survey; meta-control. ([AAAI][9])
* **LRTA*** original/notes. ([McGill School of Computer Science][8])
* **MCTS** survey. ([Incomplete Ideas][4])
* **MPC** tutorial/survey. ([ScienceDirect][17])
* **Thompson Sampling** tutorial + analysis. ([Stanford University][21])
* **CVaR RL** algorithms. ([arXiv][5])
* **MAP-Elites** (quality-diversity). ([arXiv][6])
* **LangGraph, MCP, Temporal, NATS, KEDA, Ray, RLlib** official docs and overviews. ([LangChain Docs][2])

You wanted “real research.” There it is. Now give this brief to your copilot and let it scaffold the boring parts while you pretend to be a strategic visionary who totally planned this from the start.
