# HFO Safety Integration: Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-30T17:20Z | **Classification:** Research Guidance | **Status:** Ready for Review

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Adopt proven platform engineering patterns to prevent compounded AI hallucinations in HFO. Implementation: 8 safety patterns over 12 weeks, integrated with existing PREY workflow and Independent Verify gate. All patterns sourced from battle-tested systems (Google, Netflix, CNCF). Zero new invention required.

## The Problem

**Compounded hallucinations** occur when AI-generated errors propagate through agent systems, creating cascading failures. Current HFO Gen21 has safety measures but lacks automated enforcement used by top platform teams.

## The Solution: Defense in Depth

## Implementation Roadmap: Cold Start to SOTA

### Week 0: Cold Start (Prerequisites)
- [ ] GitHub repo with CI/CD
- [ ] Python/Node.js environment
- [ ] Basic test framework exists
- [ ] HFO Gen21 GEM and AGENTS.md reviewed

**Exit Criteria:** Can run `npm test` or `pytest` successfully

### Weeks 1-2: Foundation (Policy + Static Analysis)
**Deliverables:**
- OPA/Conftest policies in `.conftest/policy/`
- CodeQL workflow in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- Semgrep rules in `.semgrep/hfo_rules.yml`
- All PRs must pass policy + scans

**Exit Criteria:** First PR blocked by policy; first security issue caught by CodeQL

### Weeks 3-4: Observability Foundation
**Deliverables:**
- OpenTelemetry SDK installed
- PREY phases instrumented (spans for perceive/react/engage/yield)
- Metrics exporter configured
- Basic dashboard with verify pass rate

**Exit Criteria:** Can view trace for complete PREY loop; metrics visible in dashboard

### Weeks 5-6: Progressive Delivery
**Deliverables:**
- OpenFeature client integrated
- First feature flag: `enable_experimental_verify`
- Canary deployment config (Argo or manual)
- AnalysisTemplate querying verify metrics

**Exit Criteria:** Can toggle feature flag; canary successfully rolls back on bad metrics

### Weeks 7-8: Supply Chain Integrity
**Deliverables:**
- SLSA attestations generated in CI
- Cosign signing for artifacts
- Signature verification in deploy pipeline
- Provenance in blackboard receipts

**Exit Criteria:** Cannot deploy unsigned artifact; can reconstruct full provenance

### Weeks 9-10: Docs-as-Code
**Deliverables:**
- MkDocs configured with Diátaxis structure
- ADR template and first 3 ADRs
- TechDocs build in CI
- Merge policy requires ADR link for architectural changes

**Exit Criteria:** Docs site live; ADR-001 published

### Weeks 11-12: LLM-Specific Safety
**Deliverables:**
- OWASP LLM Top-10 controls in OPA policies
- Prompt injection detection
- Output validation rules
- NIST AI RMF control mapping

**Exit Criteria:** Policy blocks direct human prompts; NIST controls documented

### Week 13+: State of the Art (Continuous Improvement)
**Activities:**
- Monitor DORA Four Keys weekly
- Tune policies based on false positive rate
- Add custom CodeQL/Semgrep rules for new patterns
- Expand feature flag coverage
- Iterate on canary analysis templates
- Maintain provenance audit trail

**Continuous Goals:**
- **DORA Metrics:** Elite performer tier (daily deploys, <1hr lead time, <5% change fail, <1hr restore)
- **Policy Effectiveness:** <5% false positive rate
- **Canary Success:** >95% pass analysis
- **Provenance Coverage:** 100% of artifacts signed

## Quick Start for New Implementer

**Goal:** Set up minimal safety stack in 1 hour

1. **Install tools** (15 min):
   ```bash
   # OPA/Conftest
   brew install conftest
   
   # Semgrep
   pip install semgrep
   
   # OpenTelemetry (Python example)
   pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk
   ```

2. **Add basic policy** (15 min):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .conftest/policy
   # Copy policy from research doc or ADR-001
   conftest test --policy .conftest/policy .
   ```

3. **Enable CodeQL** (10 min):
   - Go to GitHub repo > Security > Code scanning
   - Enable CodeQL analysis
   - Commit `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

4. **Add Semgrep CI** (10 min):
   ```bash
   semgrep --config=auto --json > semgrep-results.json
   # Add to GitHub Actions
   ```

5. **Verify setup** (10 min):
   - Open PR with intentional policy violation
   - Confirm CI blocks merge
   - Fix violation and confirm merge allowed

**Result:** Basic safety gates operational in 1 hour

## Success Metrics (How We Know It's Working)

### Quantitative
- **Policy Gate Effectiveness:** 95%+ of bad PRs blocked, <5% false positives
- **Static Analysis Coverage:** 100% of code scanned
- **Canary Success Rate:** >95% pass analysis
- **DORA Four Keys:** Progressing toward elite tier
- **Incident Reduction:** Fewer hallucinated code incidents (baseline → target)

### Qualitative
- Developers trust automated gates
- Faster Independent Verify (automation reduces manual effort)
- Increased confidence in agent outputs
- Clear audit trail for compliance

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| False positives block legitimate PRs | Medium | High | Tune policies incrementally; easy override process |
| Infrastructure cost (K8s, metrics) | Medium | Medium | Use free tiers; defer K8s until needed |
| Team learning curve | High | Low | Provide training; phase implementation |
| Over-engineering early | Medium | Medium | Start with gates only; add runtime safety later |
| Vendor lock-in | Low | High | Use CNCF/OSS standards (OpenFeature, OTel, OPA) |

## Notes

**This is a research document, not a mandate.** Treat as guidance for future implementation. All patterns are optional but recommended based on industry evidence.

**Phasing is flexible.** Can implement Week 1-2 foundation immediately; defer runtime safety (Weeks 5-8) until needed.

**HFO Alignment:** Every pattern integrates with existing Gen21 architecture. No breaking changes to PREY workflow, Swarmlord facade, or blackboard protocol.
