# Assimilator Quick Start Guide

## What is This?

The **Assimilator** is a role in the HFO (Hive Fleet Obsidian) system focused on **safe information ingestion and knowledge integration**. This guide helps you quickly understand and implement an information assimilation system.

## The Problem

You have:
- ✗ Too much information (PRs, documents, AI-generated content)
- ✗ Not enough ways to actually use it
- ✗ Hallucinations and data quality issues
- ✗ No systematic approach to organizing knowledge

## The Solution

Build a **progressive assimilation pipeline** that:
- ✓ Starts simple (30 minutes to first working prototype)
- ✓ Scales to production (handles millions of documents)
- ✓ Prevents hallucinations (multi-layer validation)
- ✓ Follows 80/20 explore/exploit ratio

## Quick Decision: Which Approach?

| Your Situation | Recommended Approach | Setup Time | Read Section |
|----------------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| "Just show me something working NOW" | Minimal Viable Assimilator | 30 min | Section 13 |
| "I have GitHub PRs to process" | GitHub Actions + LangChain | 2 hours | Sections 4, 12 |
| "I need production-grade RAG" | LlamaIndex + Vector DB | 1 week | Section 7 |
| "I want full enterprise solution" | Airflow + KCS v6 + Knowledge Graph | 1 month | Sections 6, 8, 9 |

## 30-Minute Quick Start (Minimal Viable Assimilator)

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install langchain llama-index chromadb openai python-dotenv PyGithub
```

### Create `.env` file
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
REPO_NAME=TTaoGaming/HiveFleetObsidian
EXPLORE_RATIO=0.2  # 80/20 rule
```

### Run the minimal script (Section 13)
```bash
python minimal_assimilator.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch your GitHub PRs
2. Create embeddings and store in local vector DB (Chroma)
3. Let you query: "Summarize recent PR activity"

**Result:** Working RAG system in 30 minutes, costs ~$0 (local), handles 10-100 documents.

## Understanding Explore/Exploit (80/20)

| Strategy | % of Effort | Purpose | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Exploit (80%)** | 80% | Use proven, validated knowledge efficiently | Query existing indexed PRs for answers |
| **Explore (20%)** | 20% | Discover new patterns, edge cases, improvements | Sample random PRs to find new patterns |

**Why?** Balances efficiency (using what works) with discovery (finding better approaches).

## Progressive Scaling Path

### Phase 1: PoC (Week 1-2) - **START HERE**
- **Goal:** Validate the approach works for your data
- **Stack:** LangChain + LlamaIndex + Chroma (all local, $0)
- **Output:** 50-100 documents indexed, basic RAG queries working
- **Cost:** ~$20/month (OpenAI API only)

### Phase 2: MVP (Week 3-4)
- **Goal:** Production-ready single-node system
- **Stack:** Prefect + Qdrant + Basic validation
- **Output:** Automated daily ingestion, web UI for review
- **Cost:** ~$110/month

### Phase 3: Scale-Up (Month 2-3)
- **Goal:** Handle 10k+ documents, multi-agent coordination
- **Stack:** Airflow + Pinecone + LangGraph multi-agent
- **Output:** Stigmergy-based coordination, adaptive explore/exploit
- **Cost:** ~$500/month

### Phase 4: Production (Month 4+)
- **Goal:** Enterprise-grade reliability, compliance
- **Stack:** Full observability, security, DR/HA
- **Cost:** ~$1300/month

## Key Concepts (3-Minute Read)

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
The pipeline pattern for moving data:
1. **Extract:** Get data from sources (GitHub API, files, databases)
2. **Transform:** Clean, validate, chunk, embed (this is where hallucination detection happens)
3. **Load:** Store in vector database for RAG retrieval

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
How to prevent AI hallucinations:
1. User asks a question
2. Find relevant documents (vector search)
3. Give LLM the documents as context
4. LLM generates answer grounded in sources
5. Return answer WITH citations

### KCS v6 (Knowledge-Centered Service)
Industry standard for knowledge management:
- Capture knowledge during problem-solving
- Validate and refine continuously
- Track provenance and quality metrics
- Retire outdated content

### Stigmergy (Ant Colony Pattern)
How agents coordinate without direct communication:
- Agents write to shared "blackboard" (vector DB, JSONL logs)
- Other agents read and react to changes
- Emergent coordination, no central bottleneck
- Scales to many agents working in parallel

## Hallucination Prevention (4 Layers)

```
Layer 1: Embedding Validation
└─> Compare AI output to source documents (cosine similarity)

Layer 2: Provenance Tracking
└─> Ensure every claim has a source citation

Layer 3: Contradiction Detection
└─> Check if retrieved chunks contradict each other

Layer 4: Confidence Scoring
└─> Combine all signals, route to auto-approve/review/reject
```

**Implementation:** See Section 10 for complete code examples.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to understand everything to start?**  
A: No! Start with Section 13 (30-min minimal assimilator), then gradually read other sections as you scale.

**Q: Can I run this locally without cloud costs?**  
A: Yes! Use Chroma (local vector DB) + Ollama (local LLM). Only costs are electricity.

**Q: What if I don't have GitHub PRs?**  
A: The patterns work for ANY data source - replace GitHub API with file reader, database, web scraper, etc.

**Q: How do I know if my hallucination detection is working?**  
A: Section 10 includes validation code. Manually review 20-50 outputs, measure false positive/negative rates.

**Q: Can this integrate with my existing tools?**  
A: Yes! ETL frameworks (Section 6) support plugins for virtually any tool. Start simple, add integrations later.

## Next Steps
