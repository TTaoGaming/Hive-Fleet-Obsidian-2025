2. **Impersonating humans in official exams** - Unethical and potentially illegal
3. **Using certifications for professional representation** - Fraudulent if AI-obtained

### Best Practice Approach:
**Use for system testing and capability demonstration, NOT for credential fraud**
- Focus on practice platforms and learning badges
- Be transparent about AI usage in non-proctored environments
- Use official exams only if explicitly allowed by provider
- Document testing methodology clearly
- Do not represent AI-obtained credentials as human achievements
