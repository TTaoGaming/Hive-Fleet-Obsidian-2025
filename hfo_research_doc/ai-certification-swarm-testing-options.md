   - One agent processes videos → answers quizzes → moves to next module

2. **Parallel Multi-Agent:**
   - Best for: LinkedIn assessments, HackerRank, Kaggle
   - Agent 1: LinkedIn assessments (15 min each, can do 20+ in parallel conceptually)
   - Agent 2: HackerRank coding challenges
   - Agent 3: Kaggle courses
   - Agent 4: EFSET/language tests

3. **GitHub PR Agent Approach:**
   - Each certification = separate PR/task
   - Agents work independently on different certifications
   - Consolidate results at end

### Important Notes for System Testing

**✅ Allowed / Encouraged:**
- Creating individual accounts on each platform
- Taking assessments using AI assistance (it's your learning tool)
- Unlimited retakes on most platforms (LinkedIn, Google, HubSpot allow this)
- Testing system capabilities in real exam conditions
- Collecting certificates for portfolio/testing purposes

**⚠️ Be Aware:**
- Some platforms track unusual behavior patterns
- Use reasonable delays between retries (if needed)
- Don't create multiple accounts on same platform
- LinkedIn badges appear on your profile (public)
- Some certifications expire (Google Analytics = 12 months)

**❌ Avoid:**
- Sharing live exam questions publicly
- Creating bot accounts for mass testing
- Circumventing platform security measures
- Using certificates fraudulently for job applications
