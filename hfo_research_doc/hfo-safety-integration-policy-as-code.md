# HFO Safety Integration: Policy-as-Code and Progressive Delivery

**Created:** 2025-10-30T16:45Z  
**Mission:** Incorporate industry-proven safety patterns into Hive Fleet Obsidian to reduce compounded hallucinations  
**Alignment:** Gen21 PREY workflow, Swarmlord facade, Independent Verify gate

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Adopt the stack used by top platform teams to prevent unsafe diffs from reaching humans and enable data-driven rollback. This integrates with HFO's existing safety envelope (canary, tripwires, revert) and strengthens the Independent Verify gate.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This is a research document, not production-ready code.** All code examples (OPA policies, Semgrep rules, Python snippets, YAML configs) are **illustrative templates** based on tool documentation. They require:

1. **Testing in HFO environment** before production use
2. **Adaptation to actual HFO codebase** (function names, schemas, etc.)
3. **Validation of effectiveness** through pilot implementations

**Use Case:** Decision support and implementation guidance, not copy-paste deployment.

**Self-Audit:** See `self-audit-safety-integration.md` for detailed verification of all claims and identification of templates vs. verified facts.

### Core Thesis

**Compounded hallucinations are stopped when:**
1. Hard gates prevent low-signal PRs from reaching humans (OPA/Conftest + static analysis)
2. Flags + canaries constrain blast radius with automated rollback on bad telemetry
3. Signed provenance blocks untrusted artifacts from shipping
4. Docs-as-code captures accepted truth at merge, giving agents a stable substrate

## Detailed Integration Guidance

### 1. Policy-as-Code Gates (OPA/Conftest)

**What it is:** Define merge requirements as code that blocks PRs missing proofs (tests, flags, risk notes, ownership).

**HFO Alignment:**
- Integrates with Independent Verify gate (Section 4 of Gen21 GEM)
- Extends safety envelope tripwires with executable policies
- Enforces evidence_refs requirement in blackboard receipts

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# .conftest/policy/hfo_merge_requirements.rego
package hfo.merge

deny[msg] {
  not input.has_tests
  msg = "PR must include test coverage"
}

deny[msg] {
  not input.has_blackboard_receipt
  msg = "PR must have blackboard JSONL receipt with evidence_refs"
}

deny[msg] {
  input.chunk_size > 200
  msg = "Chunk size exceeds 200 line limit"
}

deny[msg] {
  input.has_placeholders
  msg = "Placeholders (TODO, ..., omitted) found in artifacts"
}
```

**Provenance:** Netflix uses OPA broadly for unified policy; CNCF standard.

### 2. Static Analysis at Scale (CodeQL + Semgrep)

**What it is:** Automated security and quality checks that find variants of known issues.

**HFO Alignment:**
- Adds measurable tripwires to safety envelope
- Runs before Verify PASS
- Feeds into blackboard with scan results

**Implementation:**
- CodeQL: Variant-finding security queries as required GitHub check
- Semgrep: Fast custom rules for HFO-specific patterns

**Example Semgrep Rule:**
```yaml
# .semgrep/hfo_rules.yml
rules:
  - id: no-direct-human-prompt
    pattern: |
      prompt_human(...)
    message: "Workers must not prompt human directly; use Swarmlord facade"
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [python]
  
  - id: require-evidence-refs
    pattern: |
      append_blackboard(...)
    message: "Blackboard receipts must include evidence_refs"
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [python]
```

**Provenance:** GitHub CodeQL documentation, Semgrep case studies showing scaled rollout.

### 3. Feature Flags (OpenFeature)

**What it is:** CNCF standard for controlling feature rollout without code changes.

**HFO Alignment:**
- Gates risky Engage phase actions
- Enables A/B testing of agent behaviors
- Decouples deploy from release

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example: Gating a risky agent behavior
from openfeature import api
from openfeature.provider.no_op_provider import NoOpProvider

client = api.get_client()

if client.get_boolean_value("enable_aggressive_mutation", False):
    # Risky mutation logic
    perform_aggressive_mutation()
else:
    # Conservative fallback
    perform_safe_mutation()
```

**Provenance:** CNCF standard, vendor-neutral API.

### 4. Progressive Delivery (Argo Rollouts)

**What it is:** Canary deployments with automated analysis and rollback based on metrics.

**HFO Alignment:**
- Implements canary pattern from safety envelope
- Provides automated revert mechanism
- Data-driven decision making (metrics over feelings)

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# argo-rollouts/hfo-swarmlord-rollout.yml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: hfo-swarmlord
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
      - setWeight: 10
      - pause: {duration: 5m}
      - analysis:
          templates:
          - templateName: success-rate
      - setWeight: 50
      - pause: {duration: 10m}
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AnalysisTemplate
metadata:
  name: success-rate
spec:
  metrics:
  - name: verify-pass-rate
    successCondition: result >= 0.95
    provider:
      prometheus:
        query: |
          sum(rate(hfo_verify_pass_total[5m])) /
          sum(rate(hfo_verify_total[5m]))
```

**Provenance:** Google SRE playbook recommends canarying every risky change.

### 5. Supply Chain Integrity (SLSA + Cosign)

**What it is:** Cryptographically signed provenance for every artifact.

**HFO Alignment:**
- Extends blackboard receipts with cryptographic proof
- Prevents untrusted artifacts from entering PREY loop
- Enables audit trail for regeneration

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/hfo-build-and-attest.yml
name: Build and Attest HFO Artifacts

on: [push]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  attestations: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Build artifact
        run: |
          # Build HFO components
          ./scripts/build_hfo.sh
      
      - name: Generate attestation
        uses: actions/attest-build-provenance@v1
        with:
          subject-path: 'dist/*'
      
      - name: Sign with Cosign
        run: |
          cosign sign-blob --yes dist/hfo-artifact.tar.gz > dist/hfo-artifact.sig
```

**Provenance:** SLSA framework, GitHub Actions attestations, Sigstore Cosign.

### 6. Observability (OpenTelemetry)

**What it is:** CNCF standard for traces, metrics, and logs that feed canary analysis.

**HFO Alignment:**
- Instruments PREY loop phases
- Provides data for Yield feedback
- Enables DORA Four Keys tracking

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example: Instrumenting PREY phases
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def prey_loop(mission_intent):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("prey_loop") as loop_span:
        loop_span.set_attribute("mission_id", mission_intent.id)
        
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("perceive"):
            context = perceive(mission_intent)
        
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("react"):
            plan = react(context)
        
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("engage"):
            artifacts = engage(plan)
        
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("yield"):
            bundle = yield_results(artifacts)
        
        return bundle
```

**Provenance:** CNCF standard, wide adoption across platform teams.

### 7. Docs-as-Code (TechDocs + Diátaxis)

**What it is:** Keep ADRs and how-tos next to code; render in dev portal.

**HFO Alignment:**
- GEM SSOT is already docs-as-code
- Enforce Diátaxis structure (tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation)
- Require ADR link at merge

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# mkdocs.yml for HFO TechDocs
site_name: Hive Fleet Obsidian Documentation
theme:
  name: material

nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Tutorials:
    - Getting Started: tutorials/getting-started.md
    - First PREY Loop: tutorials/first-prey-loop.md
  - How-To Guides:
    - Add a New Agent: how-to/add-agent.md
    - Configure Safety Envelope: how-to/safety-envelope.md
  - Reference:
    - GEM Gen21: reference/gem-gen21.md
    - API: reference/api.md
  - Explanation:
    - PREY Workflow: explanation/prey-workflow.md
    - ADRs: explanation/adr/
```

**Provenance:** Spotify Backstage TechDocs, Diátaxis framework.

### 8. LLM-Specific Safety (OWASP LLM + NIST AI RMF)

**What it is:** Controls for prompt injection, insecure output handling, excessive agency.

**HFO Alignment:**
- Maps to Agent contract blocked_capabilities
- Enforces Swarmlord facade (no direct human prompts)
- Adds LLM-specific tripwires

**Implementation:**
```python
# Example: OWASP LLM controls in OPA policy
# .conftest/policy/llm_safety.rego
package hfo.llm_safety

import future.keywords

deny[msg] {
  input.action == "tool_exec"
  not input.has_approval
  msg = "Tool execution requires explicit approval (OWASP LLM06: Excessive Agency)"
}

deny[msg] {
  contains(input.prompt, "SYSTEM:")
  msg = "Prompt contains system override attempt (OWASP LLM01: Prompt Injection)"
}

deny[msg] {
  input.output_handler == "direct_eval"
  msg = "Direct eval of LLM output forbidden (OWASP LLM02: Insecure Output Handling)"
}
```

**Provenance:** OWASP LLM Top-10, NIST AI RMF for governance.

## Minimal Reference Architecture for HFO

### Repo Policy
- Branch protection enabled
- Required checks:
  - OPA/Conftest policy validation
  - CodeQL security scan
  - Semgrep custom rules
  - Unit tests + approval/golden tests
  - SBOM generation + SLSA attestation
  - Blackboard receipt validation

### Delivery Pipeline
- All risky paths behind OpenFeature flags
- Rollout via Argo Rollouts canary with AnalysisTemplates
- Auto-rollback on SLO breach (verify pass rate < 95%)
- Canary analysis reads from OpenTelemetry metrics

### Supply Chain
- Generate artifact attestations in CI
- Sign with Cosign
- Verify signatures in deploy jobs
- Store provenance in blackboard with evidence_refs

### Telemetry
- End-to-end OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Track DORA Four Keys:
  - Deployment frequency
  - Lead time for changes
  - Change failure rate
  - Time to restore service
- Canary analysis queries read from OTel backend

### Assimilation
- Merge requires ADR link
- TechDocs update organized by Diátaxis
- SSOT GEM is upstream truth
- Independent Verify checks docs completeness

### Governance
- Map LLM risks to OPA rules
- Enforce blocked_capabilities in agent contract
- Require evidence_refs for material actions
- Back with NIST AI RMF controls

## Why This Stops Compounded Hallucinations

### Hard Gates
Policy-as-code (OPA/Conftest) + static analysis (CodeQL/Semgrep) prevent low-signal PRs from reaching humans. Every merge must prove:
- Tests exist and pass
- Security scans clean
- Blackboard receipts complete
- No placeholders
- Chunk limits respected

### Constrained Blast Radius
Feature flags + canaries limit exposure. If a risky Engage action is gated behind a flag at 10% traffic:
- Only 10% of PREY loops use new behavior
- Metrics are continuously monitored
- Auto-rollback triggers on SLO breach
- Revert is immediate and automatic

### Provenance Chain
Signed attestations block untrusted artifacts. Every artifact in the PREY loop must:
- Have SLSA provenance
- Be signed with Cosign
- Include blackboard receipt with evidence_refs
- Pass Independent Verify gate

### Stable Substrate
Docs-as-code captures accepted truth at merge. The GEM SSOT + TechDocs ensure:
- Agents read from verified documentation
- ADRs explain why decisions were made
- Diátaxis structure prevents documentation drift
- Updates require Independent Verify PASS
