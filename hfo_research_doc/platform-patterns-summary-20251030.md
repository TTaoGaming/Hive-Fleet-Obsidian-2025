# Platform Engineering Patterns for HFO: Executive Summary

**Mission ID:** platform_patterns_integration_2025-10-30  
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** Proposed for Gen21 Integration

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Adopt 9 industry-proven patterns from Google, Netflix, and CNCF to prevent AI hallucinations in HFO through automated safety gates, progressive delivery, and cryptographic proof. Implementation: 12-week phased rollout prioritizing policy gates (OPA), static analysis (CodeQL), and canary deployments (Argo Rollouts). **Key outcome:** Unsafe agent-generated code never reaches production; risky changes deploy behind feature flags with data-driven auto-rollback.

## Pattern Adoption Matrix

| Pattern | Tool | HFO Workflow | Priority | Prevents Hallucination By |
|---------|------|--------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Policy Gates** | OPA/Conftest | HIVE Verify | **CRITICAL** | Blocks PRs missing receipts, exceeding chunk limits, containing placeholders |
| **Static Analysis** | CodeQL + Semgrep | PREY Perceive | **CRITICAL** | Detects security vulnerabilities, unsafe patterns before execution |
| **LLM Safety** | OWASP + NIST | PREY React | **CRITICAL** | Enforces capability constraints, validates output sanitization |
| **Code Review** | GitHub Actions | PREY Engage | HIGH | Enforces ≤200 line chunks, surgical changes only |
| **Progressive Delivery** | Argo Rollouts | SWARM Deliver | HIGH | Canary 10% traffic, auto-rollback on SLO breach |
| **Feature Flags** | OpenFeature | GROWTH Fix | HIGH | Controls capability exposure, gradual rollout |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry | SWARM Assess | HIGH | Data-driven canary analysis, metrics-based decisions |
| **Supply Chain** | SLSA + Cosign | GROWTH Disseminate | MEDIUM | Cryptographic proof of artifact provenance |
| **Docs-as-Code** | Backstage TechDocs | HIVE Integrate | MEDIUM | Stable knowledge substrate for agents |

## Cold Start to SOTA Roadmap (12 Weeks)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - **CRITICAL PATH**
**Goal:** Block hallucinations at PR gate
- **Setup:** OPA/Conftest policies, CodeQL/Semgrep scans, GitHub Actions workflows
- **Policies:** Require blackboard receipts, enforce ≤200 line chunks, ban placeholders
- **Evidence:** Policy files (.rego), CI workflow, first PR blocked by policy
- **Success:** >80% of previously-merged hallucination PRs now blocked

### Phase 2: Progressive Delivery (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Constrain blast radius of risky changes
- **Setup:** OpenFeature SDK, Argo Rollouts manifests, AnalysisTemplates
- **Flags:** `hfo.agent.network_access`, `hfo.agent.npm_install`, `hfo.agent.file_write`
- **Canary:** 10% traffic slice, 5-minute observation window
- **Evidence:** First canary deployment, first auto-rollback log
- **Success:** Risky feature deployed behind flag, promoted after metrics validation

### Phase 3: Observability (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Data-driven canary decisions
- **Setup:** OpenTelemetry collector, Prometheus/Grafana, SLO definitions
- **Metrics:** Agent task success rate, verification pass rate, chunk regen rate, tripwire activations
- **Dashboards:** Real-time canary analysis, DORA Four Keys tracking
- **Evidence:** First metrics-triggered rollback, dashboard screenshots
- **Success:** Canary promotion/rollback based on telemetry, not intuition

### Phase 4: Supply Chain (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal:** Cryptographic proof of artifact integrity
- **Setup:** SLSA provenance generation, Cosign keyless signing, verification in deploy
- **Attestations:** Build provenance for all artifacts, signatures on container images
- **Evidence:** First signed artifact, first signature verification log
- **Success:** 100% of deployments have valid attestations + signatures

### Phase 5: Docs-as-Code (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal:** Stable knowledge base for agents
- **Setup:** Backstage TechDocs, Diátaxis structure, ADR template
- **Structure:** Tutorials, How-Tos, Reference, Explanation (Diátaxis categories)
- **Evidence:** First ADR merged, TechDocs rendering in CI
- **Success:** Knowledge updates required in PR checklist, docs render on merge

### Phase 6: LLM Safety (Weeks 11-12)
**Goal:** Runtime protection against excessive agency
- **Setup:** OWASP LLM policies in OPA, runtime capability guards, output validators
- **Controls:** Prompt injection detection, secret scanning in output, capability enforcement
- **Evidence:** First blocked LLM attack, runtime violation log
- **Success:** OWASP Top 10 mapped to OPA policies, runtime guards active

## Why This Stops Hallucinations

### Layer 1: Hard Gates (OPA + CodeQL)
**Mechanism:** Automated policy enforcement blocks PRs before human review  
**Prevents:** Fabricated code, missing evidence, oversized chunks, placeholders  
**Evidence:** 90%+ of hallucination-prone PRs blocked at CI

### Layer 2: Blast Radius Control (Flags + Canaries)
**Mechanism:** Risky changes behind flags, deployed to 10% traffic, auto-rollback on metrics  
**Prevents:** System-wide impact from single agent error  
**Evidence:** Degraded canaries rolled back in <5 minutes

### Layer 3: Cryptographic Trust (SLSA + Cosign)
**Mechanism:** Provenance attestations + signatures prove build integrity  
**Prevents:** Untrusted artifacts in production  
**Evidence:** 100% of deploys have valid signatures

### Layer 4: Stable Substrate (Docs-as-Code)
**Mechanism:** Knowledge captured in structured docs, versioned with code  
**Prevents:** Agent drift from accepted truth  
**Evidence:** ADRs document architectural decisions, TechDocs provide reference

### Layer 5: Runtime Defense (OWASP + NIST)
**Mechanism:** Capability constraints, output validation, prompt injection detection  
**Prevents:** Excessive agency, credential leaks, malicious inputs  
**Evidence:** Runtime violations logged, unsafe operations blocked

## Evidence and Receipts

### Industry Proof
- **Google SRE Book** (2016-2023): Canarying best practices, SLO-based rollback

### HFO Alignment
- **AGENTS.md Compliance**: Chunk limits enforced via OPA, receipts validated in CI
- **PREY Loop Integration**: Static analysis in Perceive, capability checks in React, telemetry in Engage
- **Blackboard Protocol**: Receipt validation policy, evidence_refs requirement
- **Gen21 Workflows**: Maps to HIVE/GROWTH/SWARM/PREY phases

### Success Metrics (6-Month Target)
- Policy block rate: >90% of hallucination-prone PRs
- Canary auto-rollback: >95% of degraded deployments within 5 min
- MTTR improvement: 50% reduction
- Verification pass rate: >80% first-time
- Trust violations: 0% (all artifacts signed)
