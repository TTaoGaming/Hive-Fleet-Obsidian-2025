## Architecture

### Disperse-Converge Pattern
```
Mission Intent
      ↓
   Swarmlord (orchestrator)
      ↓
   Disperse (parallel execution)
      ├─ Lane 1 (explore mode)
      ├─ Lane 2 (explore mode)  
      └─ Lane 3 (exploit mode)
      ↓
   Converge (aggregate results)
      ↓
   Verify Quorum (2/3)
      ├─ Immunizer (consistency, grounding)
      ├─ Disruptor (adversarial probes)
      └─ Verifier_Aux (safety, policy)
      ↓
   PASS → Digest
   FAIL → Retry (narrower scope)
```

### PREY Loop (per lane)
```
Perceive (sense context)
    ↓
React (plan approach)
    ↓
Engage (execute safely)
    ↓
Yield (bundle results)
```

### Stigmergy (blackboard coordination)
```
All operations → Receipts → blackboard.jsonl
                               ↓
                    Evidence for verification
                               ↓
                    Audit trail for digest
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Parallel Lanes**: 2
- **Explore/Exploit Ratio**: 8:2 (80% explore, 20% exploit)
- **Quorum Threshold**: 2 of 3 validators
- **Chunk Size Max**: 200 lines
- **Auto Retry Max**: 3 attempts
- **Safety Envelope**: Enforced with tripwires

### Environment Variables
All configurable via `.env`:
```bash
HFO_MISSION_ID=mission_2025-10-30
HFO_PARALLEL_LANES=2
HFO_EXPLORE_EXPLOIT_RATIO=8:2
HFO_CHUNK_SIZE_MAX=200
HFO_AUTO_RETRY_MAX=3
HFO_QUORUM_THRESHOLD=2
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Demo (no API key)
bash run_multi_crew.sh demo

# 2. Test setup
bash run_multi_crew.sh test

# 3. Production (requires API key)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add OPENAI_API_KEY
bash run_multi_crew.sh production
```

### Direct Python
```bash
# Demo
python scripts/demo_multi_crew_mission.py

# Setup test
python scripts/test_multi_crew_setup.py

# Production

        # existing validators...
    }
```

### Customizing PREY Phases
Edit agent goals/backstories in `create_prey_agents()`

### Adjusting Configuration
Edit `.env` or pass environment variables
