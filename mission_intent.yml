goal: Safely remove nested .git directories from backups to prevent repo corruption, then commit and push changes to testing branch.
constraints: Respect .gitignore (e.g., exclude large env dirs); no deletions outside backups.
success_criteria: No nested .git found after cleanup; clean git status with no conflicts; successful push to origin/testing.
safety:
  tripwire: if rm fails or .git not found, abort
  canary_plan: dry-run ls before rm
  revert_plan: git reset --hard HEAD~1 if push fails.
