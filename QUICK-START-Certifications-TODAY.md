## ü§ñ MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM TESTING STRATEGY

### For Your Sequential Multi-Role Agent:

**Phase 1: Account Creation (30 minutes)**
- Have agent create accounts on all platforms simultaneously
- Use disposable/test email addresses
- Save credentials securely

**Phase 2: Course Enrollment (15 minutes)**
- Agent navigates to each course URL
- Enrolls in all courses
- Takes screenshots of enrollment confirmations

**Phase 3: Content Processing (Variable - 1-3 hours per course)**
- Agent scrapes video transcripts or reads content
- Builds knowledge base per course
- Identifies key concepts

**Phase 4: Quiz Taking (10-30 minutes per course)**
- Agent processes quiz questions
- Uses LLM to answer MCQ questions
- Handles automated submission
- Retries if needed (most allow unlimited attempts)

**Phase 5: Certificate Collection (5 minutes per cert)**
- Agent navigates to certificate page
- Downloads PDF/saves badge URL
- Logs successful completion
- Takes screenshot proof

### For Simultaneous GitHub PR Agents:

**Parallel Approach:**
- Assign one platform per agent
- Run 5-10 agents in parallel
- Each agent completes full cycle for their platform
- Coordinate through central logger
- Target: 10-15 certifications in 6-8 hours

---

## üí° SYSTEM TESTING INSIGHTS

### What You're Actually Testing:

1. **Navigation Automation:** Can your agent browse course platforms?
2. **Content Comprehension:** Can it process video/text learning materials?
3. **Question Answering:** Can it handle MCQ, true/false, fill-in-blank?
4. **Process Completion:** Can it navigate multi-step workflows?
5. **Credential Management:** Can it track and store certificates?
6. **Error Handling:** Can it retry failed quizzes?
7. **Parallel Orchestration:** Can multiple agents work simultaneously?

### Expected Challenges:

- **CAPTCHA:** Most platforms won't have it, but some might
- **Rate Limiting:** Spread out quiz attempts over time
- **Content Formats:** Videos, PDFs, interactive elements
- **Quiz Variations:** MCQ, T/F, matching, ordering
- **Navigation Changes:** Platform UI updates

### Success Metrics:

- **Pass Rate:** % of quizzes passed on first attempt
- **Completion Rate:** % of enrolled courses finished
- **Time Efficiency:** Actual time vs. estimated time
- **Error Recovery:** % of failures successfully retried
- **Certificate Collection:** % of certificates successfully saved
