- **Pheromone Color:** ðŸŸ¢ (steady) â€” automation sweeps catch drift before Overmind notices.
- **North Star:** Convert lvl0 toil into deterministic pipelines so the Overmind directs strategy, not housekeeping.
- **Zero-Trust Reminder:** Automation writes logs with provenance hashesâ€”manual overrides require dual attestation (Guardian + Sustainer).

## BLUF Capsule

Gem 1 Pass 5 locks lvl0 automation. A pointer-aware audit script corrals stray gems, the Obsidian Synapse blackboard now syncs JSONL â†” DuckDB on schedule, and the daily ritual pipeline generates linted todo ledgers without human formatting. Best-in-class SOPs from GitOps, NASA flight rules, and Atlassian facilitation fuse into a single automation charter: sense, decide, act, and memorializeâ€”all while the Overmind stays in dialogue. Immediate priorities are to stress-test the automation mesh, log the new SOPs in the blackboard, and prepare lvl1 staffing handoff playbooks.

## Lvl0 Automation Checklist (Pass 5 Focus)

| Item                          | Owner (Role)     | Status |
|-------------------------------|------------------|--------|
| Pointer-aware gem audit script | Sensor         | ðŸŸ¢    |
| Virtual stigmergy mesh generator | Integrator    | ðŸŸ¢    |
| DuckDB sync + checksum job    | Effector        | ðŸŸ¢    |
| Dual-attestation override flow| Guardian        | ðŸŸ¡    |
| Automation chaos drills       | Challenger      | ðŸŸ¡    |
| SLA dashboard instrumentation | Sustainer       | ðŸŸ¢    |
| Automation KPI publication    | Evaluator       | ðŸŸ¢    |

## Guardrail & Automation Commitments
1. **Automate from Gem Outward:** Any new artifact begins with gem update; scripts regenerate docs/templates downstream.
2. **Pointer Enforcement:** `gems/ACTIVE_GEM1.md` is now the single dynamic reference. Scripts fail fast on drift.
3. **Ledger Parity:** JSONL â†” DuckDB sync runs on schedule; mismatches halt automation until resolved.
4. **Dual Attestation:** Manual overrides require Guardian + Sustainer CLI approval recorded in ledger.
5. **Chaos Budget:** Challenger runs at least one automation-failure simulation per day to maintain resilience.

## Automation Validation Matrix

| Pipeline       | Primary Tests                          | Schedule              | Escalation Hook                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Pointer Audit  | Path whitelist, pointer hash parity, rogue gem relocation | Hourly + on commit   | Guardian â†’ Sustainer if mismatch persists 2 runs |
| Ritual Generator | Heading order lint, diagram count check, BLUF length validation | On-demand + daily 05:05 UTC | Evaluator summary pushed to Overmind digest |
| Ledger Sync    | JSONL â†” DuckDB row parity, checksum replay, schema diff guard | Hourly delta + nightly full sync | Sustainer triggers rollback and chaos drill |
| Chaos Harness  | Failure injection (network drop, permission loss, conflicting pointer) | Daily randomized slot | Challenger files remediation capsule to blackboard |
| Override Flow  | Dual-attestation prompt, ledger receipt, pointer lock re-check | Weekly rehearsal     | Guardian ensures Overmind ack within 2 hours |

- Validation is codified in `scripts/validation_matrix.yaml` (to be generated by automation) so future swarmlings inherit the contract without spelunking historical docs.
- Each pipeline publishes a `validation_run` event with `automation_id`, `scenario`, `result`, and `recovery_time_ms` fields appended to the blackboard.
- Evaluators analyze validation drift weekly; any metric trending below 95% success for 3 runs triggers an automatic gem diff proposal that the Overmind can bless or reject.

## Automation Change Management
- **Proposal Intake:** Automation alterations begin with a gem patch and linked issue in the blackboard; proposal includes blast radius, rollback path, and affected guardrails.
- **Review Cadence:** Guardian reviews security implications, Sustainer validates reliability posture, Challenger drafts adversarial probes. Overmind receives a concise BLUF once reviewers sign off.
- **Shadow Deployment:** Non-breaking changes deploy in shadow mode first, duplicating outputs to sandbox DuckDB tables. Evaluators compare telemetry for divergence before promotion.
- **Promotion Ritual:** Once shadow results clear, Effector automations switch the live flag, ledger records the time, pointer hash, and reviewer approvals. The ritual generator injects a celebratory gratitude pulse to reinforce compassionate power.
- **Post-Promotion Audit:** Within 24 hours, automation reruns chaos drills against the new configuration to confirm resilience. Failures auto-open remediation stubs referencing the original proposal.

## Chaos Drill Catalog (Pass 5 Baseline)
1. **Pointer Sabotage:** Tamper with `gems/ACTIVE_GEM1.md`, ensure audit script restores the correct pointer and logs incident within 60 seconds.
2. **Ledger Skew:** Delete DuckDB tables mid-sync; automation must recreate schema, replay JSONL, and emit a parity report without manual intervention.
3. **Ritual Jam:** Introduce malformed Markdown headings in a generated todo draft; lint should fail closed and block the Overmind until remediation completes.
4. **Credential Expiry:** Rotate automation service tokens unexpectedly; Guardian automation hands off new secrets via SOPS bundle and documents the event.
5. **Blackboard Flood:** Inject 10k synthetic telemetry events to test ingestion throttles and ensure Evaluator dashboards remain responsive.

- Chaos drills rotate across the week so no scenario gathers dust. Performance metrics (MTTR, containment success, collateral impact) are logged for retrospective analysis.
- Results feed the adopt â†’ adapt â†’ ascend spine, guaranteeing that every failure hardens the automation mesh for the next horizon.
