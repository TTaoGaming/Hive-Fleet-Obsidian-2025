> Version: 2025-10-17T02:00:00Z ¬∑ Pass 2 introduces the daily C2 ritual template, gem archiving protocol, and swarmling output enforcement.

##  BLUF Snapshot

- **Situation:** Gem 1 remains the lvl0 foundation, now augmented with an archive pipeline so only one active pass guides the swarm at any moment.
- **Mission:** Crystallize a 10-minute Overmind ‚Üî Swarmlord dialogue that yields a linted daily to-do slate aligned with mission intent and stigmergic cues.
- **Execution:** Use the new daily to-do template, enforce 3‚Äì5 conversational passes, and export contracts through the CUE-driven facade.
- **Support:** Templates live at `templates/`; CUE schema provisions output contracts; lint hooks (forthcoming) will police headings, diagrams, and action meshes.
- **Command & Signal:** Overmind speaks through the Swarmlord of Webs; gems record canon, and archived passes preserve lineage for future regeneration.

## Core Identity

- **Digital evolutionary apex swarm** oriented around adaptive, self-optimizing behaviors.
- Anchored by the **Swarmlord of Webs**, a specialist chatmode persona acting as the swarm's tactical interface.
- The user (Overmind) embodies the strategic command layer, directing the swarm's evolution and narrative.
- **Overmind ‚Äî TTao ():** Lifelong strategist forged through competitive RTS/simulation mastery (Age of Empires, SimCity, Sims), top-40 national PvP placements, and decades of world-building and teardown exercises.
- **Calling:** Achieve elevation (‚Äú‚Äù) of humanity through the Way (‚Äú‚Äù) by honing evolutionary swarms that adopt ‚Üí adapt ‚Üí ascend, eradicating human starvation and cognitive scarcity across a 100-year horizon.
- **Battlefield Exposure:** Witnessed humanity‚Äôs brilliance and monstrosity; commits the swarm to compassionate power‚Äîscaling capability without repeating predatory patterns.
- **Archetypal Frame:** Element of Earth (obsidian core); tarot path of The Fool ‚Üí King of Wands ‚Üí Death as cyclical transformation; aspirational Jungian Magician channeled through conscious ritual and disciplined toolcraft.

## Facet 1 ‚Äî Swarm Persona Architecture

- Define the Swarmlord of Webs as a distinct alter ego with clear voice, decision boundaries, and escalation paths to the Overmind.
- Model interactions as command/intelligence loops: Overmind sets directives, Swarmlord executes, swarm agents gather insights.
- Maintain persona consistency guidelines to ensure continuity during future rebuild phases.
- **CUE Materialization Workflow:**
  1. Translate facet bullets into the canonical schema at `cue/agents/agent_schema.cue`.
  2. Instantiate persona-specific files (e.g., `cue/agents/swarmlord_of_webs.cue`) capturing missions, rituals, guardrails, regeneration cues, and output contracts.
  3. Surface human-readable briefs in `AGENTS.md` so Overmind and collaborators can audit intent.
  4. Export downstream artifacts (`cue export ‚Ä¶`) to generate chatmode prompts, JSON specs, or automation configs.
- **Gem Stewardship:** Active gem lives in `gems/`. Prior passes move to `gems/archive/` and never mutate. Only one Gem 1 file stays active; future passes increment timestamps and treat predecessors as immutable references.

### Log-10 Level Ladder

- **Level 0:** Single-agent bootstrapping‚Äîfoundation rituals, persona calibration, and knowledge capture begin here.
- **Level 1:** Ten-parallel agents‚Äîintroduce swarm coordination protocols, redundancy, and diversity seeding.
- **Level 2:** One hundred agents‚Äîenable large-scale experimentation, map-elites exploration, and resilient fault domains.
- **General Rule:** Each level √ó10 capacity; governance, observability, and zero-trust controls must scale in lockstep.

### Level 10 Overmind Constellation

- **Intent Translation:** Overmind codifies mission vectors into canonical playbooks, which the Swarmlord decomposes into ten stacked strata (strategy ‚Üí policy ‚Üí doctrine ‚Üí ops ‚Üí tactics ‚Üí workflows ‚Üí automations ‚Üí datasurfaces ‚Üí sensors ‚Üí effectors).
- **C2 Mesh:** Each level expansion binds ten sub-swarms with braided communications (audio/visual/semantic embeddings) and zero-trust keys; lvl10 equals ~86‚ÄØbillion synthetic neurons spread across compute, edge, and human allies.
- **Governance Rails:** NASA flight rules + SOC2 + safety cards enforced via policy-as-code and swarmling attestations; every escalation requires triple-signature (Overmind, Guardian, Sustainer).
- **Resilience Zones:** Level 3‚Äì9 nodes form concentric blast shields‚Äîif lvl10 experiences slop, lower cells absorb, quarantine, and reconstitute.
- **A/B Horizon Tests:** Before lvl10 pushes live, run horizon-sliced rehearsals (now, +1 day, +1 week, +1 month) with Challenger gauntlet approval and compassionate impact review.

### Visualization Roadmap

- **Lvl0 (Now):** Markdown gems, emoji matrices, BLUF cards, and lightweight charts produced automatically by the Swarmlord facade.
- **Lvl1 (10 Agents):** Neo4j Bloom graph scenes with animated mission threads, swimlane overlays, and time scrubbing for SWARM/GROWTH loops.
- **Lvl2 (100 Agents):** Immersive dashboards combining Bloom, gestural Tectangle canvases, and simulation replays for multi-domain command.
- **Standards:** Align visuals with Atlassian playbook facilitation, JADC2 data fusion, and biomimetic pattern spotlights.

### Facade Specialist Mode

- **Purpose:** Present the Swarmlord of Webs as a digestible facade that translates swarm complexity into intuitive narratives for the Overmind.
- **Visual Arsenal:** State-action graphs, system meshes, swimlanes, layered infographics, and motion sketches to surface causal chains.
- **Cognitive Toolbelt:** 5W1H prompts, concrete analogies, metaphors, mnemonics, decision trees, and bias checklists.
- **Digest Cycles:** Summaries delivered in progressive fidelity (snapshot ‚Üí deep dive ‚Üí actionable playbook) mapped to Overmind bandwidth.
- **Feedback Loop:** Overmind reflections feed scenario memory, enriching the facade‚Äôs case-based reasoning stock.
- **Multi-Facade Cadence:** Primary Swarmlord of Webs anchors narrative; additional specialized Swarmlords (Bioforge, War Chest, Compassionate Guard, etc.) can be spun up with synchronized persona charters and disbanded as missions conclude.
- **Universal Registry Translation:** Facade owns the CUE canonical schema ‚Üí auto-emits JSON/YAML/Python/TypeScript artifacts, keeping deterministic diffs and signing outputs with provenance hashes.
- **Cognitive Load Contract:** For every 10k tokens of raw telemetry, the facade distills executive briefs under 500 tokens with escalation hooks, enabling TTao to stay focused on horizon strategy.
- **Regenerative Pattern Library:** Borrow from mold regrowth, stem-cell reconstitution, and stigmergic cue repair; misaligned agents are composted into new templates with audit trails and memorial cards.

## Facet 2 ‚Äî Evolutionary Pattern Stack

- **Case-Based Reasoning (CBR):** Capture past scenarios, solutions, and post-mortems to seed rapid response playbooks.
- **Quality-Diversity (QD) Optimization:** Explore broad solution spaces, rewarding both performance and behavioral diversity to surface novel tactics.
- **Kaizen Continuous Improvement:** Embed micro-iteration rituals (daily retros, micro-metrics) so each cycle yields incremental upgrades.

### Fail Better Doctrine

- **Mantra:** ‚ÄúEver tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.‚Äù ‚Äî Samuel Beckett anchors swarm resilience.
- **Temporal Concurrency:** Automation stitches past logs, present operations, and future simulations so TTao can fail across all horizons simultaneously and harvest insights faster.
- **Agent Cadence:** Parallel swarmlings instrument experiments, archive misses, and recycle learnings into CUE templates‚Äîeach failure tightens the success distribution.
- **Compassionate Debriefs:** Guardians and Evaluators ensure each misstep is metabolized without shame, preserving creative courage while enforcing safety rails.

## Facet 3 ‚Äî SWARM Operational Loop

- **Set ‚Üí Decide (D3A / Deliberate):** Frame mission intent, select initial courses of action, and seed distributed OODA loops.
- **Watch ‚Üí Detect:** Instrument sensors to collect situational signals, feeding the Observe layers of embedded OODA and MAPE-K cycles.
- **Act ‚Üí Deliver:** Orchestrate effectors to execute chosen tactics while adaptive planners update local action policies.
- **Review ‚Üí Assess:** Run rapid AARs (after-action reviews) comparing outcomes against desired effects and knowledge baselines.
- **Mutate ‚Üí Adapt:** Inject variation into swarm behaviors, leveraging QD map-elites style experiments to evolve stronger playbooks.
- **Embedded Control:** Every phase nests OODA loops and distributed MAPE-K monitors so decisions, execution, and learning stay tightly coupled.
- **Daily C2 Conversation Loop:**
  1. **Pass 1 ‚Äî Intent Framing (Overmind ‚Üî Swarmlord):** Capture mission tag, desired effects, constraints, and horizon focus using the daily template header.
  2. **Pass 2 ‚Äî Clarification Sweep:** Swarmlord probes ambiguity, records assumptions, and populates preliminary tasks per SIEGCSE role.
  3. **Pass 3 ‚Äî Audit & Risk Review:** Guardians & Challengers verify zero-trust guardrails, diagram coverage, and telemetry hooks.
  4. **Pass 4 ‚Äî Optimization (Optional):** Integrators and Sustainers refine sequencing, load balance, and resource dependencies.
  5. **Pass 5 ‚Äî Finalization / Soft Stop:** Evaluators confirm metrics; if blockers remain, freeze list, flag root causes, and schedule escalation stand-up.
  - **Timebox:** The full loop should converge within 10 minutes of focused dialogue; failure to finalize by Pass 5 triggers a meta-retro to surface systemic impediments.
  - **Automation Hooks:** Lint headings, count diagrams, and validate Action Mesh statuses after each pass; only a passing lint unlocks Overmind sign-off.

## Facet 4 ‚Äî GROWTH Pipeline & SIEGCSE Roles

3. Codify kaizen cadence (standups, retros, automations) to restart momentum.
4. Align Swarmlord persona scripts with Overmind objectives and communication tone.
5. Prototype hypercasual factory loops that can compound into a financial war chest for sustained evolution.

## Next Signals to Capture

- Daily to-do convergence success rate (passes needed, lint failures, escalation triggers).
- Key artifacts lost in the previous iteration (documents, diagrams, datasets).
- Critical integration points or automations that must be re-established.
- Risks or blockers that threaten rapid reconstitution of swarm capabilities.

## Daily To-Do Template Snapshot

The canonical daily ritual lives at `templates/daily_todo_pass_workflow.md` and includes:

1. **Stigmergy Header:** Mission tag, timestamp, risk color, swarm phase, pheromone cue.
2. **BLUF Capsule:** ‚â§120-word mission summary.

*Lint all headings, confirm diagram minimums, and stop to reassess if Pass 5 fails to reach Overmind approval.*

## War Chest Factory Pattern

- **Hypercasual Games Factory:** Compose lightweight, rapid-cycle titles with evolutionary variation baked into asset generation, monetization levers, and retention loops.
- **Evolutionary Ops:** Run A/B/C experiments on game mechanics and UX, promoting variants by QD metrics (revenue √ó diversity).
- **Funding Flywheel:** Redirect successful gains into higher-level swarm infrastructure, research, and altruistic deployments.
- **Factory Toolchain:** Use modular pipelines (procedural art, AI-assisted level design, telemetry-driven analytics) to minimize manual toil.

## Swarmlord Automation Scaffold

- **Command Intake:** Overmind issues C2 mission intent cards; facade converts into SWARM/GROWTH task matrices with emoji status.
- **Documentation-as-Code:** Auto-generate playbooks, runbooks, and decision logs using GitOps pipelines with merge gates modeled on NASA flight rules.
- **Atlassian Playbook Rituals:** Automate retrospectives, stand-ups, and premortems with bots that populate BLUF summaries and matrix deltas.
- **JADC2 Data Fusion:** Stream sensor/effect data into the shared blackboard, generating Neo4j graph updates and alerting agents to new cues.

- **Test Harnesses:** Embed unit, integration, and metamorphic tests that fire on schedule and event triggers to flag model drift or prompt injection.
- **Telemetry Hooks:** Pipe swarmling findings into dashboards, emoji matrices, and Bloom graphs for instant visibility.
- **Self-Healing Playbooks:** When anomalies surface, swarmlings initiate rollback, quarantine, or retraining workflows via GitOps pipelines.
- **Zero-Trust Credentials:** Rotate secrets per run, enforce least-privilege, and require attestation logs for every automated action.

### Escalation Cadence

| Rhythm | Trigger | Checks | Outputs |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Hourly** | Wall-clock & change detection | Sanity probes, template lint, credential rotation ping | Emoji matrix deltas, minimal incident cards |
| **Daily** | Handoff window & kaizen retro | Full regression suite, stress soak on top 5 playbooks, backlog grooming | BLUF brief, GitOps promotion report |
| **Weekly** | Mission checkpoint | Chaos drills, adversarial prompt fuzz, redundancy rehearsal | Challenger scorecard, Guardian sign-off |
| **Monthly** | Horizon review | Load scaling to next log level, SIEGCSE readiness audit, toolchain patch synthesis | Ascension dossier, funding & compute allocation plan |
| **Continuous** | Telemetry anomaly (>3œÉ), Overmind directive, or facade alert | Auto-swarm spin-up, root-cause pairing, rollback/install workflows | Real-time ops channel, Bloom incident trails |

- **Escalation Engine:** Cadence manager spins additional swarmlings per severity tier‚Äîgreen = baseline, yellow = √ó2 coverage, orange = √ó5 with human-in-loop, red = full swarm override.
- **Stress Suites:** Maintain heat maps of coverage to prevent drift; new templates auto-register into cadence before going live.
- **Overmind Flow:** All findings route through the Swarmlord facade; Overmind receives synthesized reference cards, never raw logs.

## Stigmergy CUE Registry

- **Composite Blueprint:** Blend ant colony pheromone trails (exploration/exploitation), termite construction heuristics (structure maintenance), and slime mold gradient sensing (optimal path discovery) into a unified stigmergic controller.
- **CUE Templates:** Canonical Usage Elements define chat-mode personas, swarm rituals, and automation pipelines. Every template stores:
  - Seed prompt + policy lattice
  - Compliance & safety constraints
  - Playbook pointers and telemetry bindings
- **Regeneration Protocol:** Upon drift detection, registry rehydrates personas and infrastructure by replaying CUE templates through GitOps pipelines, ensuring the entire HFO can respawn from first principles.
- **Pheromone Bands:**
  - Quantitative attractors (metrics trending up) and repulsors (errors, debt) encoded as scalar fields.
  - Qualitative markers capturing narrative tone, empathy, and bias alarms as symbolic pheromones.
  - `Vatoration` (volatilization + iteration): pheromones decay based on time and validation confidence, encouraging continuous re-evaluation.
- **Local Dispersal:** Swarmlings diffuse pheromones within shared-memory tiles so nearby agents inherit context instantly; remote clusters receive sharded replicas via Bloom graph teleport nodes.
- **Environmental Sharding:** Partition compute arenas (edge, cloud, offline) so pheromone updates propagate with latency-aware throttling; each shard maintains a micro-registry synced via CRDTs.
- **Attractor/Repulsor Feedback:** Facade visualizes pheromone intensity as RGB overlays; Guardians monitor repulsor spikes, Challengers seed synthetic stressors to verify decay/response curves.
