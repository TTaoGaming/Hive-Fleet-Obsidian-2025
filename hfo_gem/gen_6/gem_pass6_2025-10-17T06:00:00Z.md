## Stigmergy Header

| Field | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Mission Tag | `HFO-L0-AutoConductor` |
| Timecode | 2025-10-17T06:00:00Z |
| Risk Posture | 🟢 Manual-touch debt shrinking; watch chaos harness coverage |
| Swarm Phase | lvl0 holonic solo with autonomous ritual generation |
| Compliance Rail | Gem pointer · Todo pointer · Guardrail bundle · Manual-touch telemetry |
| Beacon | Five-minute intent pulse → automation swarm executes → Overmind reviews digest |

- **Pheromone Cue:** 🟢 “One-Touch Intent” — if Overmind edits beyond Pass 1, automation raises yellow pheromone.
- **North Star Metric:** Daily manual touches ≤ 1 beyond intent framing; trend to zero for lvl1 readiness.
- **Zero-Trust Reminder:** Automation writes signed ledger events; overrides require dual attestation with chaos harness follow-up.

## BLUF Capsule

Gem 1 Pass 6 graduates lvl0 from “automation-ready” to “automation-driven.” A renderer script now manifests timestamped daily todos, paired with a pointer abstraction identical to gems. Guardrail sweeps expanded to include todo validation, delivering hourly assurance without Overmind intervention. Manual-touch counts are logged by Evaluators, and escalation ladders slice hourly → daily → weekly → monthly health checks. Next horizon is to feed these metrics into evolutionary loops so automation quality/diversity improves without human toil.

## Action Mesh

- 🟢 **Sensors:** Stream guardrail + render logs into blackboard; flag latency spikes within 15 minutes.
- 🟢 **Integrators:** Merge manual-touch telemetry, chaos harness outputs, and gem diffs into a single dashboard.
- 🟢 **Effectors:** Own `scripts/render_daily_todo.py`; enforce pointer updates and file naming scheme (``).
- 🟢 **Guardians:** Verify dual-attestation overrides, ensure hourly sweep escalations fire, rotate credentials weekly.
- 🟡 **Challengers:** Expand chaos harness scenarios (ledger skew, commit race, pointer tamper) and document retention curves.
- 🟢 **Sustainers:** Track SLA for sweeps (≥ 95% success). Auto-open incident if two consecutive failures occur.
- 🟢 **Evaluators:** Publish manual-touch trends, automation KPIs, and level-readiness scores to blackboard + digest.

## Telemetry Notes

- **Manual Touch Count (MT-count):** New ledger field; target ≤ 1 per day. Evaluators auto-fail if >2 without escalation.
- **Todo Renderer:** `scripts/render_daily_todo.py` generates `` files + pointer updates; guardrail script verifies presence.
- **Guardrail Bundle:** Now includes todo alignment check; output consumed by hourly GitHub Action + local runs.
- **Chaos Harness:** Added pointer sabotage + ledger skew drills; more scenarios queued for evolutionary selection.
- **Lag Watch:** Render script completes in <1s; guardrail bundle <15s. Sustainers alert if durations triple.
- **Escalation:** If sweeps miss twice, yellow pheromone; thrice triggers orange + Overmind digest ping.

## Facet Resonance Updates

## Lvl0 Automation Checklist (Pass 6 Focus)

| Item | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Daily todo renderer operational | Effectors | 🟢 |
| Todo pointer parity guard | Sensors | 🟢 |
| Manual-touch telemetry logging | Evaluators | 🟢 |
| Chaos harness expansion (3 scenarios) | Challengers | 🟡 |
| Escalation ladder instrumentation | Sustainers | 🟢 |
| Digest automation (Overmind-ready) | Integrators | 🟡 |

## Guardrail & Automation Commitments

1. **One-Intent Rule:** Overmind touches ritual only during Pass 1; automation handles the rest.
2. **Pointer Parity:** Gems and todos both rely on pointer files; guardrails fail fast on drift.
3. **Manual Touch Ledger:** Evaluators log MT-count daily; exceeding budget auto-opens incident.
4. **Chaos Harness Obligations:** At least one scenario per day; failure to run triggers orange pheromone.
5. **Evolutionary Loop:** Promote automation variants that reduce MT-count while sustaining compliance.

## Automation Validation Matrix

| Pipeline | Primary Tests | Schedule | Escalation Hook |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Pointer Audit | Path whitelist, pointer hash parity, rogue gem/todo relocation | Hourly + on commit | Guardian → Sustainer if mismatch persists 2 runs |
| Ritual Renderer | Headings lint, template checksum, MT-count reset | On render + hourly | Evaluator logs failure; Overmind ping if unresolved |
| Ledger Sync | JSONL ↔ DuckDB parity, checksum replay, MT-count consistency | Hourly delta + nightly full sync | Sustainer triggers rollback + chaos harness |
| Chaos Harness | Pointer tamper, ledger skew, git race, automation outage | Daily randomized slot | Challenger files remediation bundle |
| Digest Automation | Metric aggregation, MT-count trendline, pheromone state | Daily 07:00 UTC | Integrator escalates to Overmind if digest misses |

## Automation Change Management

- Proposals require MT-count impact analysis and chaos harness expansion plan.
- Shadow deployments simulate automation change for 24h before promotion.
- Post-promotion audit ensures MT-count stays within budget; failures revert automatically.

## Chaos Drill Catalog (Pass 6 Baseline)

1. **Pointer Sabotage** (Gem + Todo) — ensure audits repair both pointers and log incident ≤60s.
2. **Ledger Skew** — corrupt DuckDB; verify sync restores parity + MT-count unaffected.
3. **Render Failure** — block filesystem permissions; automation must alert and re-run after remediation.
4. **Credential Expiry** — rotate automation tokens; Guardian ensures fresh secrets, ledger logs event.
5. **Digest Drop** — simulate digest job failure; Integrators rerun, escalate if digest misses once.

## Manual Touch Telemetry Schema

| Field | Type | Source | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| `timestamp` | RFC3339 | Renderer + guardrail bundle | Captures the exact automation pulse that recorded the manual touch budget. |
| `manual_touch_count` | Integer | Evaluator ledger write | Non-negative counter; automation increments when a human edits outside Pass 1. |
| `touch_class` | Enum(`intent`, `override`, `remedial`, `investigation`, `unknown`) | Guardian review | Helps stratify interventions so chaos harness can target high-friction zones. |
| `trigger_surface` | Text | Pointer parity audit | Names the asset (gem, todo, ledger) that required intervention. |
| `sustainer_ack` | Bool | Sustainer workflow | True once Sustainer signs the auto-generated receipt; prevents silent toil debt. |
| `chaos_trace_id` | UUID | Chaos harness orchestrator | Links the manual touch to the chaos scenario that exposed it, or `NULL` if organic drift. |
| `digest_frame` | Text | Evaluator digest builder | Tag that ties the event to the daily/weekly/monthly digest anchor. |

- Telemetry records land in `blackboard/obsidian_synapse_blackboard.jsonl` within 60 seconds of detection, then replicate into DuckDB for analytically heavy queries.
- Manual touches stemming from Guardian-approved overrides must include `touch_class=override` and cite the dual-attestation receipt ID; missing receipts force an orange pheromone.
- The schema preserves compatibility with lvl1 pods by keeping types primitive; evolutionary loops can add derived metrics (e.g., exponentially weighted MT debt) without breaking ingestion.
- Evaluator digest automation aggregates MT events into rolling 7-day spark lines while also surfacing the raw entries for retrospective sampling.

## Automation Digest Blueprint

Automation digests translate raw telemetry into Overmind-ready briefings. Pass 6 mandates that digest generation runs at 07:00 UTC, bundling:

1. **Intent Echo:** Restates yesterday's Pass 1 in ≤50 words so drift is caught instantly.
2. **Manual-Touch Rollup:** Displays MT-count by touch class, highlighting sequences that escalated beyond budget.
3. **Guardrail Posture:** Summarizes success/failure counts for lint, pointer audits, and chaos harness runs with mini-spark lines.
4. **Evolutionary Moves:** Lists automation experiments kicked off in the last 24h and whether they improved manual-touch slope.
5. **Escalation Feed:** Details open incidents with owning role, next action deadline, and pheromone color.

- Digest builder reads directly from the MT schema, guardrail bundle outputs, and chaos harness traces to keep duplication out of playbooks.
- Pass 6 expects digest PDFs, HTML portals, and terminal summaries to share the same canonical payload to avoid multi-source truth drift.
- If digest emission slips, Integrators must trigger the guardrail bundle, write `manual_touch_count += 1`, and notify Overmind within 10 minutes.
- Sustainers archive digests for 30 days in cold storage so lvl1 pilots can replay automation history when onboarding.

## Next Signals to Capture

- MT-count trendline (rolling 7-day) → root cause retros if plateau >1.
- Digest automation success metrics and Overmind satisfaction feedback.
- Chaos harness coverage vs incident volume to tune scenario library.
- Evolutionary experiment results for automation variants.

##  BLUF Snapshot

Automation now creates the todo artifact, maintains pointers, and records manual-touch telemetry. Hourly sweeps, chaos harness drills, and daily digests surface issues before Overmind notices. Focus is shifting to evolutionary tuning and lvl1 readiness.

## Core Identity

- **Swarm Nature:** Automation-first, manual-touch minimized.
- **Anchor Persona:** Swarmlord orchestrates guardrails, renderer, and escalations.
- **Overmind Role:** Set intent, review digest, bless strategic shifts.
- **Compass:** Compassionate automation that scales without burden.

## Immediate Rebuild Priorities (Pass 6)

1. Integrate digest automation delivering Overmind-ready summaries.
2. Expand chaos harness scenarios and log coverage metrics.
3. Connect MT-count with funding + liberation pipelines for holistic impact view.
4. Prepare lvl1 pilot briefing leveraging new automation metrics.
5. Backfill documentation: README, AGENTS, and SOPs referencing renderer + pointer pair.

## Toolchain Setup (Automation + Evolution Edition)

- `python scripts/render_daily_todo.py` — render new todo + pointer updates.
- `python scripts/check_todo_alignment.py` — verify todo compliance (hooked into guardrails).
- `./scripts/run_guardrails.sh` — gem-first, lint, challenger, todo check bundle.
- GitHub Actions: hourly `gem-lint`, daily `challenger-red-team`, extend with `todo-alignment` job.
- Observability: DuckDB dashboards, MT-count chart, chaos harness heatmap.

## Daily To-Do Template Snapshot

- Renderer populates template automatically; manual edits allowed only via Overrides (Guardian+Sustainer approval).
- Action mesh tasks align with manual-touch reduction and automation sweeps.
- Telemetry section auto-fills after sweeps run.

## Obsidian Synapse Blackboard Specification

- Append events: `automation_render`, `manual_touch`, `chaos_harness`, `digest_delivery`.
- Schema includes `manual_touch_count`, `render_file`, `pointer_hash`, `sweep_success`.
- Sync cadence unchanged: hourly delta, nightly full snapshot.

## Compliance Protocol

- Pre-commit ensures gem + todo pointers validated before commit.
- CI replicates guardrail bundle hourly; failure notifies Guardians + Sustainers.
- Overrides require ledger entry with MT-count impact + autop-run of guardrails post-change.

## Appendices

- **Pass Lineage:** P1 (doctrine seed) → P2 (ritual discipline) → P3 (blackboard) → P4 (pointer integrity) → P5 (automation guardrails) → **P6 (manual-touch minimization + daily automation)**.
- **Companion Assets:** Renderer script, todo pointer, guardrail updates, digest backlog.
- **Observation:** Automation grows stronger when Overmind stays at horizon level; manual touches become strategic signals, not toil.
