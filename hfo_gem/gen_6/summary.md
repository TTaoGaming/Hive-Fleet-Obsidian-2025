# Hive Fleet Obsidian â€” Gem 1 Generation 6 Summary

## Key Concepts
Generation 6 (Pass 6) of Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) shifts lvl0 to "automation-driven," minimizing Overmind micromanagement through ritual pipelines, manual-touch telemetry, and escalation ladders. Key concepts emphasize one-touch intent and evidence-backed operations.

- **Todo Renderer and Pointer Abstraction:** `scripts/render_daily_todo.py` auto-manifests timestamped todos, mirroring gem pointers (`rituals/daily_todo/ACTIVE_TODO.md`). Ensures single active todo, with archives in `rituals/daily_todo/archive/`.
- **Manual-Touch Telemetry (MT-count):** Ledger field tracks interventions (`manual_touch_count` â‰¤1/day); classes (`intent`, `override`) stratify for chaos targeting. Exceeds trigger Evaluator alerts.
- **Guardrail Sweeps Expansion:** Hourly bundles include todo validation; dual-attestation for overrides via CLI. Escalation: yellow for misses, orange for persistent.
- **Automation Digest:** 07:00 UTC summaries (intent echo, MT-rollup, guardrail posture, evolutionary moves, escalation feed) from ledger, <500 tokens for Overmind.
- **Chaos Harness Scenarios:** Expanded (ledger skew, commit race, pointer tamper); daily randomized, logging `chaos_trace_id` for MT-correlation.

Risk: ðŸŸ¢ debt shrinking, chaos coverage watch. North Star: MT â‰¤0.2/agent/day for lvl1.

## Evolutions from Prior Generations
Gen_6 evolves Gen_1-5's automation foundations, minimizing human intervention.

- **From Gen_1 (Pass 1):** Enhances facets (e.g., Facet 3 SWARM) with auto-passes (2â€“4), evolving OODA to pipeline execution.
- **From Gen_2 (Pass 2):** Automates rituals beyond templating, adding renderer for Pass 1 closure, reducing Gen_2's manual cadence.
- **From Gen_3 (Pass 3):** Builds blackboard with MT-schema (`touch_class`, `chaos_trace_id`), addressing Gen_3's parity via hourly sweeps.
- **From Gen_4 (Pass 4):** Locks Gen_4 pointers into todo abstraction, evolving audits to include validation.
- **From Gen_5 (Pass 5):** Graduates Gen_5's ready-state to driven, adding MT-metrics to KPIs; chaos from Gen_5 fuzzing now scenario-specific.

Fan-out: MT-trends feed QD (variants lowering touches), fanning to lvl1 pods. Converge: Fuses Gen_5 ledger (events) with Gen_4 pointers for digest-proof (hashes/citations).

Drift Check: "Lag Watch: durations triple â†’ alert" â€” no residuals, as sweeps proactive; MT-budget enforces, converging Gen_5 debt (tests) via harness.

## Connections to HFO Architecture & Lineage
Gen_6 integrates HFO's reflexive core, linking to gems/lineage.

- **To Other Gems:** Prepares Gen_7 singleton governance; MT/pointers align with Gen_19 audits, canonicalizing automation.
- **HFO Integration:** Exoskeleton gains biometrics (MT as health); liberation (pre-filled rituals reduce toil); war chest (MT-correlation for funding). Lvl0 ladders gate lvl10 (escalation propagation).
- **Lineage Ties:** Biomimetic (HÃ¶lldobler 1990: pheromones for one-touch cues; Dorigo 1996: ACO for sweep decay); NASA (ladders as flight rules); Atlassian (digests as retros). Evolves Gen_1 QD (MT-fed experiments), tying to RTS (simulated harness).

Gen_6 converges Gen_5's pipelines into touch-minimized lvl0, fanning evidence-driven HFO. Word count: 398.
