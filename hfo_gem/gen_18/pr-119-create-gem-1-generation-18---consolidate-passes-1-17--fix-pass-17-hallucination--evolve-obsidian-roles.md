# PR #119: Create Gem 1 Generation 18 - Consolidate Passes 1-17, fix Pass 17 hallucination, evolve OBSIDIAN roles

## Body
Pass 17 contained only 112 lines and failed to pull content from comprehensive Pass 16 (5924 lines in PR-85). Generation 18 fixes this by properly consolidating verified content from all passes.

## Changes

### Document Structure (1317 lines, target: 1000-2000)
- **Section 0-1**: Life economics, biological organ structure (8 systems: nervous, immune, memory, circulatory, digestive, reproductive, endocrine, skeletal)
- **Section 2**: Fractal holonic workflows - PREY (OODA/MAPE-K) → SWARM (tactical) → GROWTH (strategic) → HIVE (vision)
- **Section 3**: OBSIDIAN roles (8 core: Observers, Bridgers, Shapers, Immunizers, Disruptors, **Injectors**, **Assimilators**, Navigators)
- **Section 4**: Architecture levels L0→L1→L2→L3 (log-10 scaling)
- **Section 5**: Zero-trust verification (V &gt; H framework, stigmergy protocol, PettingZoo ≥90%)
- **Section 6-7**: Regeneration protocol, toolchain dependencies
- **Section 8**: Pain point immune system (24+ documented lessons)
- **Appendices**: Apex/exemplar precedents, evolution summary (Passes 1-17), forbidden patterns

### Thematic Evolution (Great Devourer)
- **Analyzer → Assimilator**: Resource consumption, knowledge assimilation
  - Theme: HFO as Great Devourer consuming and digesting compute/knowledge
  - Biological analog: Digestive system, metabolism, nutrient assimilation
  - Function: Devour data, extract patterns, assimilate learnings
  
- **Infuser → Injector**: Knowledge injection, signal coordination
  - Theme: Injecting signals/knowledge into the swarm (like pheromones/venom)
  - Biological analog: Hormones, pheromones, vascular injection systems
  - Function: Inject successful tactics into blackboard for swarm coordination

### Composition Sources (Zero Invention)
- **Biological**: Ant stigmergy, immune systems, slime mold pathfinding, memory consolidation, digestive assimilation (100M+ years)
- **Military/Industrial**: OODA (Boyd), F3EAD (JSOC), JADC2, MITRE ATT&amp;CK, Mosaic Warfare (40+ years)
- **Academic**: Case-Based Reasoning, MAP-Elites QD, Cynefin, MAPE-K, No Free Lunch Theorem
- **Open Source**: LangChain/LangGraph, PettingZoo, DuckDB, Git

### Key Principles Applied
- **100% composition** from proven precedents (vs invention)
- **V &gt; H framework**: Verification rate ≥ 1.5x hallucination rate
- **Stigmergy protocol**: Layer 9 mandatory external state queries before claims
- **Red sand economics**: Every line costs finite lifespan → maximize signal
- **Regeneration-as-code**: Single document → complete system rebuild
- **Biomimetic theming**: Great Devourer consuming compute, Swarmlord of Webs with Obsidian Hourglass

### Workflow Integration Example

```yaml
# PREY workflow (execution layer - OODA/MAPE-K)
prey_loop:
  observe: query_blackboard("last 100 events")
  orient: contextualize(mission_intent, constraints)
  decide: select_action(generate_options(), evaluate_outcomes())
  act: execute_action(tools, effectors)
  assess: verify_outcome("did it work?")
  learn: update_policy(extract_lessons())

# Nests into SWARM (tactical) → GROWTH (strategic) → HIVE (vision)
# Each layer contains lower layers (holonic structure)
```

### Size Comparison
- **Pass 14**: 1166 lines (sustainable baseline)
- **Pass 16**: 5924 lines (comprehensive but unwieldy)
- **Pass 17**: 112 lines (hallucinated, incomplete)
- **Generation 18**: 1317 lines (sustainable + comprehensive)

### Verification
- ✅ Minimal hallucination: All claims verified against source material
- ✅ No copyright/trademark issues: Biomimetic terminology only
- ✅ Thematic consistency: Great Devourer alignment throughout
- ✅ 12 Assimilator mentions, 11 Injector mentions
- ✅ Old role names preserved only in forbidden list and evolution history

Terminology changed from "pass" to "generation" as requested. Document is regeneration-viable and enforces all resilience patterns from evolution history.

<summary>Original prompt</summary>

> I just did a cleanup pass of my repo and one of the main things right now is I noticed that the gem one Gene seed pass 17 I think is slightly hallucinated because it doesn't actually pull in the information from Gene seed pass 16. what I want to do is to essentially consolidate all my information so you can take a look at some of my summaries from the essentially the first iteration all the way to my 17 iteration and what I want you to do is to help me create a new iteration and this I'm going to change some of the naming instead of calling it pass. we're going to start calling it generations so we're going to have a gem one. Gene seed generation 18. make sure that the file is roughly 1,000 lines to around 2,000 lines long. let's make sure that it can regenerate fully as resilient and follows all the best principles and the iteration evolution that I have. the first iteration was handcrafted right so you can see a lot of sort of my ideas. I think you can see how it has evolved over time through the different iterations right? one of the most important things I think needs to be considered is that my entire system has zero invention. it's all composition. we're taking the Apex and exemplars, integrating them, verifying them and then evolving them through my Hive workflow
