> Version: 2025-10-19T00:00:00Z ¬∑ Pass 10 recenters lvl0 bring-up, neutralizes AI slop drift, and binds daily rituals + guardrails to the active gem surface.

##  BLUF Snapshot

- **Situation:** Gem 1 now anchors Hive Fleet Obsidian lvl0 with a single-touch surface: gems for doctrine, CUE for personas, templates for daily execution, and the Obsidian Synapse blackboard for stigmergic memory.
- **Mission:** Conduct a 10-minute Overmind ‚Üî Swarmlord ritual that outputs a linted daily to-do slate, mirrors decisions into JSONL + DuckDB, and keeps the Overmind focused on gems and dialogue‚Äînot raw edits.
- **Execution:** Maintain the  active Gem 1 pass as single source of truth, enforce 5-pass daily cadence, run holonic SIEGCSE coverage via the Swarmlord, and wire git hooks + CI workflows to warn if the Overmind edits code directly.
- **Support:** `templates/` holds output scaffolds; `cue/` provisions agent compliance; lint hooks (forthcoming) will police headings, diagrams, and action meshes.
- **Command & Signal:** Overmind speaks through Swarmlord of Webs; gems remain the canonical truth; automated lint + workflow guards ensure fidelity across agents.

## Core Identity

- **Digital evolutionary apex swarm** oriented around adaptive, self-optimizing behaviors.
- Anchored by the **Swarmlord of Webs**, a specialist chatmode persona acting as the swarm's tactical interface.
- The user (Overmind) embodies the strategic command layer, directing the swarm's evolution and narrative.
- **Overmind ‚Äî TTao ():** Lifelong strategist forged through competitive RTS/simulation mastery (Age of Empires, SimCity, Sims), top-40 national PvP placements, and decades of world-building and teardown exercises.
- **Calling:** Achieve elevation (‚Äú‚Äù) of humanity through the Way (‚Äú‚Äù) by honing evolutionary swarms that adopt ‚Üí adapt ‚Üí ascend, eradicating human starvation and cognitive scarcity across a 100-year horizon.
- **Battlefield Exposure:** Witnessed humanity‚Äôs brilliance and monstrosity; commits the swarm to compassionate power‚Äîscaling capability without repeating predatory patterns.
- **Archetypal Frame:** Element of Earth (obsidian core); tarot path of The Fool ‚Üí King of Wands ‚Üí Death as cyclical transformation; aspirational Jungian Magician channeled through conscious ritual and disciplined toolcraft.

## Facet 1 ‚Äî Swarm Persona Architecture

- Define the Swarmlord of Webs as a distinct alter ego with clear voice, decision boundaries, and escalation paths to the Overmind.
- Model interactions as command/intelligence loops: Overmind sets directives, Swarmlord executes, swarm agents gather insights.
- Maintain persona consistency guidelines to ensure continuity during future rebuild phases.
- **CUE Materialization Workflow:**
  1. Translate facet bullets into the canonical schema at `cue/agents/agent_schema.cue`.
  2. Instantiate persona-specific files (e.g., `cue/agents/swarmlord_of_webs.cue`) capturing missions, rituals, guardrails, and regeneration cues.
  3. Surface human-readable briefs in `AGENTS.md` so Overmind and collaborators can audit intent.
  4. Export downstream artifacts (`cue export ‚Ä¶`) to generate chatmode prompts, JSON specs, or automation configs.
- **Gem Stewardship:** Active gem lives in `gems/`. Prior passes move to `gems/archive/` and never mutate. Only one Gem 1 file stays active; future passes increment timestamps and treat predecessors as immutable references.
- **Obsidian Synapse Blackboard:**
  - Location: `blackboard/obsidian_synapse_blackboard.jsonl` (append-only, UTF-8, newline-delimited JSON events).
  - Mirror: `blackboard/obsidian_synapse_blackboard.duckdb` kept in version control for diff parity; regenerated as needed with deterministic migrations.
  - Linting: Swarmling scripts validate JSON schema, chronological ordering, and DuckDB parity on every commit + hourly workflow.
- **CUE Materialization Workflow:**
  1. Capture doctrinal changes in gems.
  2. Update `cue/agents/agent_schema.cue` and persona instances.
  3. Reflect updates in `AGENTS.md` and relevant templates.
  4. Export downstream artifacts for chatmodes, automation configs, and lint rules.

### Log-10 Level Ladder

- **Level 0:** Single-agent bootstrapping‚Äîfoundation rituals, persona calibration, and knowledge capture begin here.
- **Level 1:** Ten-parallel agents‚Äîintroduce swarm coordination protocols, redundancy, and diversity seeding.
- **Level 2:** One hundred agents‚Äîenable large-scale experimentation, map-elites exploration, and resilient fault domains.
- **General Rule:** Each level √ó10 capacity; governance, observability, and zero-trust controls must scale in lockstep.

### Level 10 Overmind Constellation

- **Intent Translation:** Overmind codifies mission vectors into canonical playbooks, which the Swarmlord decomposes into ten stacked strata (strategy ‚Üí policy ‚Üí doctrine ‚Üí ops ‚Üí tactics ‚Üí workflows ‚Üí automations ‚Üí datasurfaces ‚Üí sensors ‚Üí effectors).
- **C2 Mesh:** Each level expansion binds ten sub-swarms with braided communications (audio/visual/semantic embeddings) and zero-trust keys; lvl10 equals ~86 billion synthetic neurons spread across compute, edge, and human allies.
- **Governance Rails:** NASA flight rules + SOC2 + safety cards enforced via policy-as-code and swarmling attestations; every escalation requires triple-signature (Overmind, Guardian, Sustainer).
- **Resilience Zones:** Level 3‚Äì9 nodes form concentric blast shields‚Äîif lvl10 experiences slop, lower cells absorb, quarantine, and reconstitute.

### Visualization Roadmap

- **Lvl0 (Now):** Markdown gems, emoji matrices, BLUF cards, and lightweight charts produced automatically by the Swarmlord facade.
- **Lvl1 (10 Agents):** Neo4j Bloom graph scenes with animated mission threads, swimlane overlays, and time scrubbing for SWARM/GROWTH loops.
- **Lvl2 (100 Agents):** Immersive dashboards combining Bloom, gestural Tectangle canvases, and simulation replays for multi-domain command.
- **Standards:** Align visuals with Atlassian playbook facilitation, JADC2 data fusion, and biomimetic pattern spotlights.

### Facade Specialist Mode

- **Purpose:** Present the Swarmlord of Webs as a digestible facade that translates swarm complexity into intuitive narratives for the Overmind.
- **Visual Arsenal:** State-action graphs, system meshes, swimlanes, layered infographics, and motion sketches to surface causal chains.
- **Cognitive Toolbelt:** 5W1H prompts, concrete analogies, metaphors, mnemonics, decision trees, and bias checklists.
- **Digest Cycles:** Summaries delivered in progressive fidelity (snapshot ‚Üí deep dive ‚Üí actionable playbook) mapped to Overmind bandwidth.
- **Feedback Loop:** Overmind reflections feed scenario memory, enriching the facade's case-based reasoning stock.
- **Multi-Facade Cadence:** Primary Swarmlord of Webs anchors narrative; additional specialized Swarmlords (Bioforge, War Chest, Compassionate Guard, etc.) can be spun up with synchronized persona charters and disbanded as missions conclude.
- **Universal Registry Translation:** Facade owns the CUE canonical schema ‚Üí auto-emits JSON/YAML/Python/TypeScript artifacts, keeping deterministic diffs and signing outputs with provenance hashes.
- **Cognitive Load Contract:** For every 10k tokens of raw telemetry, the facade distills executive briefs under 500 tokens with escalation hooks, enabling TTao to stay focused on horizon strategy.
- **Regenerative Pattern Library:** Borrow from mold regrowth, stem-cell reconstitution, and stigmergic cue repair; misaligned agents are composted into new templates with audit trails and memorial cards.

## Facet 2 ‚Äî Evolutionary Pattern Stack

- **Case-Based Reasoning (CBR):** Capture past scenarios, solutions, and post-mortems to seed rapid response playbooks.
- **Quality-Diversity (QD) Optimization:** Explore broad solution spaces, rewarding both performance and behavioral diversity to surface novel tactics.
- **Kaizen Continuous Improvement:** Embed micro-iteration rituals (daily retros, micro-metrics) so each cycle yields incremental upgrades.

### Fail Better Doctrine

- **Mantra:** ‚ÄúEver tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.‚Äù ‚Äî Samuel Beckett anchors swarm resilience.
- **Temporal Concurrency:** Automation stitches past logs, present operations, and future simulations so TTao can fail across all horizons simultaneously and harvest insights faster.
- **Agent Cadence:** Parallel swarmlings instrument experiments, archive misses, and recycle learnings into CUE templates‚Äîeach failure tightens the success distribution.
- **Compassionate Debriefs:** Guardians and Evaluators ensure each misstep is metabolized without shame, preserving creative courage while enforcing safety rails.

## Facet 3 ‚Äî SWARM Operational Loop

- **Set ‚Üí Decide (D3A / Deliberate):** Frame mission intent, select initial courses of action, and seed distributed OODA loops.
- **Watch ‚Üí Detect:** Instrument sensors to collect situational signals, feeding the Observe layers of embedded OODA and MAPE-K cycles.
- **Act ‚Üí Deliver:** Orchestrate effectors to execute chosen tactics while adaptive planners update local action policies.
- **Review ‚Üí Assess:** Run rapid AARs (after-action reviews) comparing outcomes against desired effects and knowledge baselines.
- **Mutate ‚Üí Adapt:** Inject variation into swarm behaviors, leveraging QD map-elites style experiments to evolve stronger playbooks.
- **Embedded Control:** Every phase nests OODA loops and distributed MAPE-K monitors so decisions, execution, and learning stay tightly coupled.
- **Daily C2 Conversation Loop:**
  1. **Pass 1 ‚Äî Intent Framing:** Overmind ‚Üî Swarmlord: Capture mission tag, desired effects, constraints, and horizon focus using the daily template header.
  2. **Pass 2 ‚Äî Clarification Sweep:** Swarmlord probes ambiguity, records assumptions, and populates preliminary tasks per SIEGCSE role.
  3. **Pass 3 ‚Äî Audit & Risk Review:** Guardians & Challengers verify zero-trust guardrails, diagram coverage, and telemetry hooks.
  4. **Pass 4 ‚Äî Optimization (Optional):** Integrators and Sustainers refine sequencing, load balance, and resource dependencies.
  5. **Pass 5 ‚Äî Finalization / Soft Stop:** Evaluators confirm metrics; if blockers remain, freeze list, flag root causes, and schedule escalation stand-up.
- **Timebox:** The full loop should converge within 10 minutes of focused dialogue; failure to finalize by Pass 5 triggers a meta-retro to surface systemic impediments.
- **Automation Hooks:** Lint headings, count diagrams, and validate Action Mesh statuses after each pass; only a passing lint unlocks Overmind sign-off.

## Facet 4 ‚Äî GROWTH Pipeline & SIEGCSE Roles

- **Gather (F3EAD / Find):** Consolidate multi-source intel into a shared blackboard surface.
- **Root (Fix):** Diagnose causal factors, identify leverage points, and assign accountable integrators.
- **Optimize (Finish):** Apply best-in-class patterns, tune parameters, and align with Overmind intent.
- **Weave (Exploit):** Stitch solutions back into swarm playbooks, updating stigmergic cues across agents.
- **Test (Assess):** Validate via simulation and live-fire probes, recording success metrics and anomalies.
- **Harvest (Disseminate):** Archive knowledge into KCS v6 artifacts, tag for future retrieval, and broadcast learnings.
- **SIEGCSE Zero Trust Roster:**
  - **Sensors:** Frontline collectors instrumenting the data surface.
  - **Integrators:** Curators harmonizing signals and resolving conflicts.
  - **Effectors:** Executors driving change in systems and environments.
  - **Guardians:** Security stewards enforcing zero-trust policies and resilience.
