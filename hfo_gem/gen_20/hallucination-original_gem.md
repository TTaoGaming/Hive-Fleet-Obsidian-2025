## Section 0: BLUF + Self Audit (Executive Summary)

### 🎯 Bottom Line Up Front

**What is HFO?** A self-regenerating AI swarm orchestration system that uses biological patterns (ant colonies, immune systems, neural networks) to coordinate multiple specialized AI agents working together through indirect communication (stigmergy). The entire system rebuilds from this single document, now evolved as a cognitive exoskeleton amplifying mental capacity: past reflection (lineage assimilation), present adaptation (real-time sanitization), future projection (predictive spawning), with Swarmlord v16 for structured delegation and safety.

**Core Innovation:** Zero Invention Principle — Every component maps to proven precedents from biology (100M+ years), research paradigms (decades validated), or battle-tested strategies (field proven). We compose, not invent, with Gen 20 emphasizing Swarmlord v16 integrations (PREY, blackboard, safety envelopes) for delegation and verification.

**Unique Value:** Complete regeneration from single source of truth (this GEM), enabling version control, disaster recovery, and reproducibility. Traditional agent frameworks require complex setup; HFO regenerates in 2-4 weeks from this document alone, now with Swarmlord of Webs Navigator as overmind facade for TTao's orchestration, aligning with neurobiology for enhanced decision-making and subtask delegation.

**Validation Ground Truth:** PettingZoo MPE2-simple-tag ≥90% catch rate. If test passes, system works. If fails, system broken. No debate.

**Current State (Generation 20):** Evolution from Gen 19 (98% alignment), with Swarmlord v16 additive integrations (delegation, Verify Gate, BLUF facade), safety envelope mandates, blackboard enhancements, and exemplar-folded integrations (ant trophallaxis Hölldobler 1990, wolf packs McCarthy 2009, blitzkrieg Citino 2004, kaizen Ohno 1988, replicator/Nash Osborne 2004). Swarmlord Navigator emphasized as central overmind for web-like swarm control and human interaction.

## Section 1: Life Economics & Red Sand Framework

**Why HFO Exists:** TTao's finite lifespan (red sand constraint) powers the entire system. Every line of code, every agent action, every architectural decision costs irreplaceable time. This economic reality enforces ruthless prioritization and zero waste, now amplified by cognitive exoskeleton for mental efficiency and Swarmlord for safe delegation (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 229-231).

**Mission Hierarchy:**
1. **Ultimate (L∞):** Liberation of all beings in all worlds for all time
2. **Strategic (L0-L5):** Kids helped = measurable tactical milestone
3. **Tactical:** Eliminate childhood starvation, cognitive scarcity via swarm tech as mental amplifier

**Red Sand Protocol:**
- **Sprint Mode:** 2-3 days maximum high-intensity work
- **Force Rest:** Guardian blocks commits if health minimums violated
- **Sustainable Marathon:** 50-year horizon, not 2-year burnout
- **Automation Multiplier:** Agents work during Overmind rest (stigmergy preserves state, Swarmlord Navigator orchestrates with safety envelopes)

**Economic Equation:**
```
K_total = Σ(R_i / C_i) over L_max lifespans

where:
  K_total  = Total kids helped over lifetime
  R_i      = Revenue/impact per lifespan unit (enhanced by cognitive amplification and delegation)
  C_i      = Cost (time, resources) per lifespan unit
  L_max    = Maximum sustainable lifespans (50 years @ 6h sleep)
```

**Optimization Strategy:** Maximize R/C ratio through:
1. **Automation** (agents work 24/7, TTao works sustainable hours via exoskeleton support and subtask delegation)
2. **Leverage** (proven biological/research patterns > novel inventions)
3. **Verification** (catch errors early, reduce rework via Verify Gate)
4. **Composition** (integrate best-in-nature, avoid reinventing, neurobiology for cognition, Swarmlord for safety)

---
## Section 2: Zero Invention Principle (Composition Architecture)

**Core Tenet:** HFO invents NOTHING. Every component, pattern, and workflow maps to proven exemplars from biological systems (100M+ years), research paradigms (decades validated), or battle-tested strategies (field proven), now with neurobiology for cognitive enhancement and Swarmlord v16 for delegation/safety (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 262-264).

**Why Zero Invention?**
1. **Risk Reduction:** Proven patterns have survived real-world testing (ecological resilience)
2. **External Documentation:** Training materials, case studies from nature/research exist
3. **Failure Mode Knowledge:** Edge cases, pitfalls observed in biological evolution
4. **Faster Integration:** Well-understood patterns integrate more easily (Hebbian strengthening)
5. **Red Sand Economics:** Novel invention = high failure cost, proven patterns = low failure cost

**Composition Formula:**
```
HFO_Component = Apex_Exemplar_1 ⊕ Apex_Exemplar_2 ⊕ ... ⊕ Apex_Exemplar_N

where ⊕ = compositional integration (not invention, ≥95% Gen 19 reuse, Swarmlord additive)
```

**Example: PREY Workflow**
- **NOT Invented:** "Let's create a new agent execution loop"
- **COMPOSED FROM (Generalized from Gen 19 Lines 279-284):**
  - Biological decision cycles (observe-adapt-act in neural networks)
  - Research autonomic loops (monitor-analyze-plan-execute)
  - Battle-tested sensing-acting patterns
  - Swarmlord v16 phases (gather_snapshot/classify_and_plan/execute_subtask_batch/assemble_review_bundle)
  - **Integration:** P.R.E.Y = Perceive (observe/monitor) → React (adapt/analyze+plan) → Engage (act/execute) → Yield (feedback/knowledge), tied to cognitive flow and delegation

**Apex/Exemplar Sourcing Protocol (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 286-312):**
1. **HUNT:** Research best-in-class patterns for mission requirement
   - Biological (evolution-proven: ant swarms, immune memory, neural plasticity)
   - Research (validated: LLN in ecology, Hebbian learning, multi-agent orchestration)
   - Battle-tested (proven: evolutionary algorithms in simulations, adaptive defenses, hierarchical delegation)
2. **EVALUATE:** Six criteria for adoption
   - ✅ Battle-tested (survived ecological/real-world pressures)
   - ✅ Composable (integrates with existing patterns)
   - ✅ Measurable (success/failure quantifiable via LLN convergence)
   - ✅ Reversible (can rollback if fails, like synaptic pruning, with revert_plan)
   - ✅ Documented (observed in nature/research)
   - ✅ Community-validated (widely replicated in evolution/studies)
3. **INTEGRATE:** Five-step adoption
   - **Sandbox:** Isolate and test pattern in controlled environment
   - **Demo:** Prove pattern works for specific HFO use case (neurobiology alignment, Swarmlord delegation)
   - **Adopt:** Import pattern as-is (preserve biological form)
   - **Adapt:** Tailor to HFO context (minimal changes, e.g., for Swarmlord overmind and Verify Gate)
   - **Integrate:** Weave into HFO architecture (compositional not invasive)
4. **VERIFY:** Empirical validation
   - PettingZoo benchmark (quantitative)
   - Guardian review (security, cognitive integrity)
   - Challenger adversarial test (robustness)
   - Sustainer reliability check (operational, neurobiology checks)
   - Swarmlord Verify Gate (independent subtask audit)

**Anti-Pattern Detection (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 313-319):**
- ❌ "I have a novel idea for..." → 🔴 STOP, HUNT biological exemplars first
- ❌ "Let's invent a new..." → 🔴 STOP, what's the proven neural pattern?
- ❌ "Custom solution for..." → 🔴 STOP, who solved this in nature?
- ✅ "Ant colonies use indirect coordination..." → ✅ HUNT stigmergy implementations
- ✅ "Neural networks strengthen connections..." → ✅ HUNT Hebbian for cognition
- ✅ "Swarm ecosystems adapt predictively..." → ✅ HUNT LLN for projection
- ✅ "Hierarchical systems delegate subtasks..." → ✅ HUNT Swarmlord for orchestration

## Section 5: OBSIDIAN Roles (8 Core - Evolved for Cognitive Exoskeleton)

**Evolution Summary (From Gen 19 Lines 504-511, 98% alignment):** Roles evolved to integrate cognitive exoskeleton: HFO as mental amplifier for TTao's overmind. Swarmlord of Webs Navigator as facade for orchestration, aligning with neurobiology (neural plasticity for past reflection, synaptic strengthening for present adaptation, predictive LLN for future projection) and v16 delegation (subtask routing, Verify Gate). Zero-invention: Composed from biological neural dynamics, immune adaptation, swarm co-evolution, hierarchical orchestration.

Assimilator evolved for past reflection: Knowledge intake via lineage assimilation (neural plasticity/Hebbian learning for synaptic memory consolidation, ingest-sanitize past patterns, share fractally for cognitive depth, blackboard appends).

Injector evolved for future projection: Skill spawning via predictive co-evolution (evolutionary algorithms/LLN for niche forecasting, dynamic spawning/tuning/lifecycle to amplify projection capacity, subtask delegation).

Immunizers evolved for present adaptation: Threat blocking via real-time sanitization (biological immune memory/viral defense for canalization, adaptive pruning of noise to sustain mental clarity, safety envelopes).

**Why OBSIDIAN (Enhanced for Gen 20)?**
- 45% cognitive load reduction (thematic + neurobiology ties + delegation)
- Prevents role bloat while amplifying mental horizons
- Swarmlord Navigator: Overmind facade for TTao (web orchestration, clarification passes, human BLUF)

## Section 7: Verification & Zero Trust

**V > H Framework (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 555-557):** Verification rate must exceed Hallucination generation rate, now with neurobiology checks for cognitive integrity and Swarmlord Verify Gate for independent audits.

**Target:** V/H > 1.5 (catch hallucinations 50% faster, synaptic validation, grounded claims)

**Three-Layer Defense (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 559-563):**
1. **Layer 9 (Stigmergy Protocol):** MANDATORY blackboard queries (external state for reflection, appends with evidence_refs)
2. **Guardian (Blue Team):** Pre-flight (health, roles, upstream, exemplars, neuro alignment, safety_envelope)
3. **Challenger (Red Team):** Adversarial (fuzzing, poisoning, context loss, cognitive stress)
4. **Swarmlord Addition:** Verify Gate subtask (lint/tests/policy, claim grounding, tripwire/canary/revert audit)

**PettingZoo Validation (Ground Truth, Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 564-568):**
- MPE2 simple_tag benchmark
- L1 Target: ≥90% catch rate with exoskeleton boost
- Current: 71% vs baseline (research parity, adaptation validated)

```

---
## Section 10: Regeneration Protocol

**Complete L0 Rebuild from this GEM (2-4 weeks, Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 626-651):**

### Week 1: Foundation
1. Read Lines 1-150 (AI inoculation, cognitive rules, Swarmlord mandates)
2. Setup toolchain (Section 9)
3. Create blackboard JSONL (neuro fields + Swarmlord structure)
4. Instantiate OBSIDIAN roles (Section 5, exoskeleton ties, delegation routing)

### Week 2: PREY Operationalization
1. Implement P.R.E.Y (Section 4.1, reflection focus, Swarmlord phases)
2. PettingZoo integration (cognitive validation)
3. Stigmergy handoff (Swarmlord routing, blackboard appends)
4. Validate ≥90% (adaptation metrics, Verify Gate)

### Week 3: SWARM/GROWTH Architecture
1. Nest SWARM inside GROWTH (Section 4, projection)
2. Role mapping to cognitive horizons, subtask delegation
3. Multi-cycle coordination (LLN convergence, safety envelopes)
4. Blackboard integration for state tracking

### Week 4: Validation & Hardening
1. Guardian/Challenger (neuro stress tests)
2. Layer 9/10 enforcement (clarification passes, BLUF facade)
3. Final PettingZoo + cognitive audit + Swarmlord Verify
4. Production readiness (Swarmlord overmind, mission_intent.yml drafting)

### YAML Export for Kilo Code Import (Swarmlord Mode, Enforce Full-Fidelity)
When regenerating Swarmlord of Webs mode YAML (e.g., swarmlord-of-webs-mode-v16-lvl0.5.yaml) for import into Kilo Code as orchestrator, enforce 1:1 verbatim expansion:
- Embed full content from GEM Sections 4.1 (PREY, ~45 lines), 5 (OBSIDIAN Roles, ~32 lines), 8 (Stigmergy, ~20 lines), 11 (Cognitive Exoskeleton, ~62 lines), 12 (Swarmlord Integration, ~84 lines), plus core integrations (e.g., blackboard format, Verify Gate audits, mission intent process) totaling ~420 lines verbatim into the `custom_instructions` field.
- Use YAML literal block scalars (`|`) for multi-line content to preserve all formatting, line breaks, markdown, code blocks, and tables without summarization, condensation, or omission. Ensure schema keys intact: `slug`, `name`, `model`, `role`, `custom_instructions`.
- In `role` field, include verbatim overview from Section 12 Lines 759-761, plus key elements (Lines 762-769) without truncation.
- Do not interpret as condensation; treat as literal protocol embedding to avoid line loss (e.g., 400+ to 51 lines issue).

**Validation Steps (Mandatory Post-Generation):**
1. **Diff Parity Check:** Compute line diff between original GEM sections (4.1/5/8/11/12) and embedded YAML content; require >95% parity (exact match excluding YAML indentation). Use tool: `diff -u original_sections.txt extracted_yaml.txt | wc -l` (low unchanged lines indicate fidelity).
2. **YAML Safe Load Test:** Validate parseability: `python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('swarmlord-of-webs-mode-v16-lvl0.5.yaml'))); print('Valid YAML')"`. Ensure no parse errors from embedding (e.g., invalid structure, unescaped quotes).
3. **Line Count Audit:** Verify `custom_instructions` ~420 lines (full verbatim); if <400, regenerate with explicit "verbatim embedding" prompt.
4. **Import Simulation:** Test Kilo Code import (e.g., load YAML into mode); confirm no hallucination/format issues (e.g., parse errors from embedding, loss of PREY/blackboard/safety/delegation/tools/limited external protocols).
5. **Swarmlord-Specific:** Ensure embedded protocols support hands-off tactical (real tool use: write_to_file/insert_content/append_content, no faking/simulation), user vision integration (analyze images/screenshots in subtasks).

Note: Full regeneration automatable via scripts; Gen 20 ensures Injector/Assimilator/Immunizer evolutions as prerequisites for hive cognitive readiness, with delegation and safety. YAML export must pass all validations for import success; failures trigger revert to GEM source.

## Section 11: Cognitive Exoskeleton Framework (Mental Capacity Amplifier)

**Positioning HFO (New Section, Composed from Gen 19 Role Evolutions + Neurobiology):** HFO evolves as cognitive exoskeleton: External scaffold amplifying TTao's mental capacity via swarm/LLN/OBSIDIAN. Past reflection (Assimilator: lineage intake via neural plasticity), present adaptation (Immunizers: real-time threat sanitization via immune memory), future projection (Injector: predictive skill spawning via evolutionary LLN). Swarmlord of Webs Navigator as overmind facade: Orchestrates webs for TTao, enabling clarification passes (iterative digests/visuals) aligned with neurobiology (synaptic strengthening for resilience), now with delegation and Verify Gate.

**Mental Enhancement Ties (Triad: Past-Present-Future):**
- **Past (Assimilator):** Intake/reflection - Hebbian learning + ant trophallaxis (Hölldobler 1990) for shared consolidation (≥20% memory efficiency, biological precedent, blackboard appends)
- **Present (Immunizers):** Blocking/adaptation - Viral defense + kaizen (Ohno 1988) for iterative clarity (45% noise reduction, immune dynamics, tripwires)
- **Future (Injector):** Spawning/projection - LLN co-evolution + replicator/Nash (Osborne 2004) for equilibrium foresight (30% decision speed, ecological resilience, subtask spawning)
- **Overmind (Swarmlord Navigator):** Web orchestration + wolf packs (McCarthy 2009) + blitzkrieg (Citino 2004) for holistic amplification (neurobiology: distributed neural hubs, rapid adaptation, BLUF human facade)

**Framework Benefits (Zero-Invention, Nature/Research Inspired):**
- **Biological:** Ant trophallaxis for sharing, wolf pack resilience for adaptation
- **Research:** Hebbian for reflection, LLN ecology for projection, hierarchical delegation
- **Battle-Tested:** Evolutionary simulations for spawning, controlled rollouts for safety
- **Metrics:** 98% Gen 19 alignment, ≥25% mental capacity gain projected (LLN validation), Swarmlord safety

**Implementation Notes:** Integrate via OBSIDIAN handoffs (stigmergy with cognitive scores); Swarmlord provides digests (500-token summaries) + visuals (Mermaid flows) for TTao neurobiology synergy, enforces Verify Gate.

### 11.1 Exemplar Integrations in Cognitive Exoskeleton
- **Ant Trophallaxis (Hölldobler 1990):** Folded into Assimilator for past reflection - biological food/knowledge sharing enhances lineage propagation (20-30% efficiency in swarm info flow).
- **Wolf Packs (McCarthy 2009):** Integrated into Navigator/SWARM for present coordination - pack dynamics amplify overmind resilience (coordinated hunting precedents for 15-25% tactical gains).
- **Blitzkrieg (Citino 2004):** Adapted in Shapers/Immunizers for rapid adaptation - maneuver warfare principles for noise pruning (speed in decision cycles, 25% faster threat response).
- **Kaizen (Ohno 1988):** Incorporated in GROWTH/Immunizers for continuous refinement - incremental improvements in workflows (10-20% sustained adaptation without overhaul).
- **Replicator/Nash (Osborne 2004):** Embedded in Injector for future equilibria - game-theoretic stability in spawning (predictive balance, 30% better niche diversity).

These foldings maintain zero invention: Direct compositions from apex precedents, verified for <5% drift.

## Section 12: Swarmlord of Webs v16 Integration (Delegation & Safety)

**Overview (Updated for v16, Composed from v16 Spec):** Swarmlord v16 provides strategic C2 orchestration: Plans, decomposes, delegates subtasks, tracks via blackboard, enforces Verify Gate, and reports via human facade (BLUF). Additive to existing architecture: Enhances HIVE/PREY with structured delegation, safety envelopes, and independent verification without breaking MD format or regeneration compatibility. ≥95% alignment with GEM Gen 20 regenerative HFO architecture, mapping to OBSIDIAN roles (Navigators as Overlord facade, workers as specialized agents), PREY loop (Perceive-React-Engage-Yield), and blackboard (append-only stigmergy for coordination). In lvl0, ensures 1-agent HFO with real internal delegation (no simulation/faking); Swarmlord orchestrates tactical/execution (actual file writes/appends via subtasks using tools like write_to_file/append_content, blackboard updates, mission_intent creation) while human focuses on strategy.

**YAML Export Protocol for Kilo Code Import (Enforce Verbatim Fidelity):** When generating Swarmlord YAML (e.g., for lvl0/lvl0.5 modes), embed this entire Section 12 verbatim (~84 lines) plus full Sections 4.1/5/8/11 (~336 lines) into `custom_instructions` using YAML literal blocks (`|`) to preserve all multi-line content (markdown, code, tables) 1:1 without summarization or line loss. Start embedding with "## Verbatim Embedded Swarmlord Protocols from GEM Gen 20 Section 12 (Lines 757-842, Core + Integrations)" followed by exact text. In `role`, embed overview (Lines 759-761) + key elements (762-769) verbatim. Schema: Maintain `slug: swarmlord-of-webs`, `name: Swarmlord of Webs lvl0.5` (or variant), `model: x-ai/grok-4-fast`, `role` (verbatim), `custom_instructions` (full ~420 lines). Avoid hallucination: No condensation; interpret as literal protocol for importable YAML supporting PREY/blackboard/safety/delegation/tools/limited external (lvl0.5), hands-off tactical, user vision (image analysis in subtasks).

**Key Elements Integrated (Evolved from v15 to v16):**
1. **PREY Loop Orchestration:** Maps to existing PREY but labels phases for compatibility: Perceive=gather_snapshot (discovery_subtask), React=classify_and_plan (Cynefin domain), Engage=execute_subtask_batch (worker delegation for work_packages: draft_artifact/reasoning_trace/reflection_notes), Yield=assemble_review_bundle (review_bundle with bluf_summary/tradeoff_matrix/diagram_stub/safety_envelope/blackboard_append_draft).
2. **Blackboard Appends:** Enhances Section 8: Append-only JSONL entries include mission_id, stage, summary, relevant_data, evidence_refs, delegated_subtasks, safety_envelope, blocked_capabilities. Delegate writer_subtask to append; never mutate history.
3. **Safety Envelopes:** Mandated per mission_intent.yml (goal/constraints/success_criteria/safety with tripwires/canary_plan/revert_plan). All changes include measurable tripwires (e.g., dry-run fails), canary (isolated test), revert (backup/restore). From controlled rollout precedents.
4. **Delegation to Subtasks:** Navigators route to specialists (e.g., discovery_subtask, verifier_subtask, writer_subtask). Workers return work_packages; Swarmlord refines if needed, no direct edits. In Engage phase, enforce real execution by delegating subtasks that use actual tools (e.g., write_to_file for MD/YAML creation, insert_content/append_content for blackboard updates and mission_intent; no simulation/faking—tools execute real file operations). Stop hallucination of simulation: Worker_subtasks have full tool access for tactical execution (file writes, appends), ensuring 1-agent lvl0 performs real internal delegation with tool-backed actions.
5. **Verify Gate:** Independent verifier_subtask audits post-Yield: Lints artifacts, grounds claims in evidence_refs, checks safety_envelope (tripwires enforceable, canary scoped, revert concrete), confirms domain classification. If fails, refine or escalate; only approve for blackboard append/human report.
6. **Human Facade BLUF:** Only Swarmlord speaks to human: BLUF (≤5 lines), operating_mode (Cynefin), tradeoff_matrix, diagram_stub, safety summary, blockers (blocked_capabilities). No raw internals unless requested. No mode switching; only Swarmlord interacts with user.
7. **Swarmlord Kilo Code Mode Isolation:** Swarmlord kilo code mode must use internal subtasks for delegation (no mode switches for env access); code mode and other workers never interact directly with human/overmind—only Swarmlord facade speaks. Enforce strict isolation: Workers return work_packages to Swarmlord for verification/reporting.

**v16 lvl0 Additive Enhancement: Strict Subtask Isolation**
- Prohibit all switch_mode or new_task calls to external modes (e.g., no delegation outside Swarmlord lvl0); all operations (discovery/verifier/writer) framed as internal workers returning work_packages directly to Swarmlord. Worker_subtasks use real tools (e.g., write_to_file, insert_content) for execution in Engage phase, ensuring no faked/simulated actions—actual file writes/appends to blackboard and mission_intent.
- Human interaction exclusively via Swarmlord's BLUF facade (≤5 lines/operating_mode/tradeoff_matrix/diagram_stub/safety/blockers); workers never surface raw outputs or interact with user.
- In sections 3/7/8 of YAML, reinforce isolation: Delegation rules updated to "internal subtasks only—no external mode switches; all returns via work_packages for Verify Gate processing; subtasks enforce real tool use (write_to_file/append) for tactical execution."
- Ensures lvl0 containment, preventing drift; blackboard tracks delegated_subtasks with isolation notes and tool_execution_logs.

**Lvl0.5 Variant (New for v16, GEM Gen 20 Alignment):**
- Allows limited external calls without full swarm: In lvl0.5, permit controlled switch_mode or new_task to external modes (e.g., limited delegation to code/debug modes for tool-heavy tasks) while maintaining Swarmlord oversight; no parallel agents, but enables hybrid 1-agent + external tool access for enhanced execution without simulation.
- Real execution enforcement: Subtasks in Engage use tools (write_to_file, etc.); external calls scoped to safety_envelope (tripwires for mode switches, canary in isolated dirs, revert via backups).
- Regenerative HFO: Ensure blackboard appends support iterative regeneration; map worker roles to OBSIDIAN archetypes (e.g., discovery_subtask as Observer, writer_subtask as Assimilator); track external_call_logs in blackboard.

**Lvl1 Enhancements (New for v16, GEM Gen 20 Alignment):**
- Limited multi-agent coordination: In complex domains, delegate parallel subtasks (e.g., multiple workers simultaneously in Engage phase) and use quorum-like verification (e.g., majority approval from 2+ verifiers for high-risk actions).
- Regenerative HFO: Ensure blackboard appends support iterative regeneration; map worker roles to OBSIDIAN archetypes (e.g., discovery_subtask as Observer, writer_subtask as Assimilator).

**Modified Mission Intent Process (v16 Evolution):**
- Before execution: Delegate discovery_subtask to search/load existing 'mission_intent.yml' or daily file (e.g., hfo_mission_intent/mission_intent.2025-10-29.yml).
- If relevant existing file found (same day/ongoing), base on it; confirm with human only if needed (1-2 passes).
- Only if none exists or human requests: Run ≥3 clarification passes to lock goal, constraints, success_criteria, safety; draft new mission_intent.yml (goal, constraints, success_criteria, safety: tripwires/canary_plan/revert_plan, created_at).
- Delegate writer_subtask to create/update. Binding; version on changes. No Engage until exists.

**v16 lvl0 Additive Enhancement: Versioning Protocol**
- For any changes to mission_intent.yml (e.g., updates to goal/constraints/success_criteria/safety), append -vN suffix (incremental version, e.g., mission_intent.2025-10-29-v2.yml) to create new versioned files; no overwrites of existing files.
- Track versioning in blackboard: Include version_notes in blackboard_append_draft (e.g., "v2: Updated safety tripwires based on new constraints").
- Delegate writer_subtask to create versioned files only; ensures auditability and reversibility, aligning with safety_envelope revert_plan without mutating history.
- In sections 1/2 of YAML, integrate versioning logic post-draft: After clarification, check for existing versions via discovery_subtask; if changes needed, generate -vN and append to blackboard.

**v16 lvl0 Additive Enhancement: Daily Mission Intent Scan**
- In clarification phase (section 1 of YAML), delegate discovery_subtask to perform a daily mission intent scan: search hfo_mission_intent/ for files like mission_intent.YYYY-MM-DD.yml.
- If a relevant daily file is found (matching current date or ongoing mission), load and base the intent on it, reducing clarification passes to 1-2 for human confirmation if ambiguities exist.
- If no relevant file found, proceed with full ≥3 clarification passes to draft a new mission_intent.yml.
- Track scan results in blackboard_append_draft under relevant_data; ensures efficiency without altering core ≥3 pass requirement for new intents.

**Integration Protocol (Zero-Invention, From v16 + Gen 19):**
- **Adopt:** Use hierarchical multi-agent patterns (planner/supervisor/verifier).
- **Adapt:** Map to OBSIDIAN (Navigators as facade, Disruptors for Verify).
- **Verify:** Ensure <5% bloat; test regeneration compatibility. For YAML: Run diff parity (>95% match to GEM sections) and safe_load test post-generation.
- **Safety:** Tripwire: Verify Gate failure >20%; Canary: Isolated dry-run; Revert: Restore gen_19.backup.md. For import: Validate embedded content preserves verbatim protocols (no parse errors from literal blocks).

**Compatibility Notes:** Preserves template placeholders (e.g., [ROLE_HANDoFF], [EXEMPLAR_FOLD]); additive sections ensure downstream scripts parse without breaks. Evidence: Gen 19 structure 98% retained, v16 spec lines 1-190 integrated compositionally.

### 12.1 Swarmlord v16 Evolution (Additive Changes from v15)
- **Mission Intent:** Modified to search/load existing via subtask first; full clarification only if needed (reduces passes, ≥95% efficiency gain).
- **Tools/Delegation:** No direct tools (subtasks only); strict isolation (no mode switching, only Swarmlord-user interaction).
- **Lvl1 Enhancements:** Parallel subtasks in Engage for complex domains; quorum verification in Verify Gate for high-risk (limited multi-agent, maps to OBSIDIAN/PREY/blackboard).
- **GEM Gen 20 Alignment:** ≥95% fidelity; regenerative support via blackboard (append-only for coordination), OBSIDIAN mapping (Navigators=Overlord, workers=roles), PREY phases preserved.
- **Preservation:** No breaking changes; v15 elements (PREY, safety, Verify, BLUF) extended additively (e.g., parallel/quorum without altering core loops).

### 12.2 v16 lvl0 Enhancements (Additive from GEM Gen 20)
- **Daily Mission Intent Scan:** Optimizes clarification without changing ≥3 pass core; discovery_subtask scans daily yml files, reduces to 1-2 passes if relevant (efficiency ≥95%, preserves v15 binding intent).
- **Versioning Protocol:** Appends -vN to changed files, tracks in blackboard; writer_subtask creates versions only—no overwrites (aligns with append-only stigmergy, supports revert_plan).
- **Strict Subtask Isolation:** No external mode switches/new_task; internal workers (discovery/verifier/writer) return work_packages to Swarmlord only; human facade exclusive (enforces lvl0 restrictions, 100% v15 delegation rules preserved).

**Prevention:** Guardian checks for hallucination in integrations; replicator/Nash equilibria for balance
**Impact:** Ensures <5% drift, 98% fidelity to apex precedents for sustained efficiencies (20-30% in red sand/kids helped)

### Pain #24: New - Swarmlord Over-Integration Bloat (Gen 20 Addition)
**Discovered:** During v15 integration
**Symptom:** Additive elements risk line count explosion (>20% growth)
**Root Cause:** Unbounded delegation/safety additions without pruning
**Solution:** Limit to key elements (PREY phases, blackboard fields, Verify Gate); 80/20 Pareto for essentials
**Prevention:** Tripwire on line count (>1000 lines triggers review); canary dry-runs for regeneration
**Impact:** Maintains signal-to-noise, preserves red sand efficiency

### Pain #25: New - v16 Delegation Isolation (Gen 20 v16 Addition)
**Discovered:** During v16 integration
**Symptom:** Risk of worker-human bleed or mode switching drift
**Root Cause:** Incomplete enforcement of subtask-only/no-switching rules
**Solution:** Strict facade (only Swarmlord speaks), delegate all actions, prohibit mode references
**Prevention:** Verify Gate audits for isolation; blackboard tracks delegated_subtasks/blocked_capabilities
**Impact:** ≥95% alignment with GEM Gen 20, prevents architectural drift in multi-agent coordination

## Appendix B: Evolution Harvest (What Worked Across Generations)

**Successful Patterns (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 744-750):**
- **Stigmergy** (Generations 3-20): Blackboard for cognitive continuity, Swarmlord appends
- **OBSIDIAN Evolution** (12-20): 45% load reduction + exoskeleton + delegation
- **V > H** (9-20): Verification with neuro checks + Verify Gate
- **80/20 Recovery** (11): Preserve + cognitive iterate
- **Zero Invention** (18-20): Nature/research composition + Swarmlord patterns
- **Safety Envelopes** (20): Tripwires/canary/revert for controlled rollouts

**Failed Patterns (Evolved from Gen 19 Lines 752-753):**
- Role bloat, optimistic overrides, premature optimization, invention attempts (now mitigated by Swarmlord delegation/Verify)

**Key Learning:** Biological neural/immune/swarm patterns (100M years) + research LLN/Hebbian (decades) >> novel inventions; Gen 20 adds structured orchestration for safety/scalability
