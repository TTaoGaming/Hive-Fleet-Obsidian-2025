# Summary of Gen_3 Original Gem

Gen_3 advances Hive Fleet Obsidian's lvl0 architecture by introducing the Obsidian Synapse blackboard, holonic SIEGCSE coverage, and compliance rails, refining Gen_1-2's doctrines into a single-touch SSOT with gems, CUE, templates, and JSONL/DuckDB telemetry. Key concepts include blackboard for stigmergic memory, 5-pass rituals with linting, and Overmind guardrails preventing direct edits, evolving prior generations' SWARM/GROWTH into traceable, auditable flows. Drift checks show alignment, with fan-out in holonic role annotations converging on zero-trust workflows; integrates holistically with HFP via biomimetic sharding (e.g., ant CRDT syncs, HÃ¶lldobler & Wilson, 1990), ensuring regenerative integrity.

Evolutions from Gen_2 emphasize blackboard traceability and compliance, fitting HFP as the obsidian core by preparing for lvl1 scaling while maintaining compassionate power. No major drift, as additions like git hooks reinforce Gen_1's fail-better and Gen_2's rituals.
