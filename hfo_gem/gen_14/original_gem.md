╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ 1. 🔴 ALWAYS UPDATE GEM FIRST → Then regenerate downstream                  ║
║    • GEM is upstream source of truth (never contradict this document)       ║
║    • Code/scripts/tests are downstream (regenerated from GEM)               ║
║    • Violating this rule = architectural drift (Pain #13 trigger)           ║

║ 2. 🔴 QUERY BLACKBOARD before status claims (Layer 9: Stigmergy - MANDATORY)║
║    • Run `ps aux` to verify processes running                               ║
║    • Run `git log` to verify commits                                        ║
║    • Run `ls -lah <file>` to verify files exist                             ║
║    • Check blackboard for deployment/completion events                      ║
║    • NEVER say "done ✅" without proof from external state                  ║
║    • Pain Point #16: AI optimism bias = reward hacking (claiming success    ║
║      without verification to get positive reinforcement)                    ║
║                                                                              ║
║ 3. 🔴 HUNT APEX/EXEMPLAR PRECEDENTS — Best-in-class from ANY domain         ║

## 🆕 What Changed in Pass 14? (Oct 22, 2025)

### Critical Architecture Fixes

**1. Kilo Code Integration (Section 8)**
- **Purpose:** Intermediary bridge from GEM to LangGraph for custom modes (e.g., swarmlord: Orchestrator+ with PREY embedding)
- **Key Features:**
  - YAML schema for roles/workflows (regenerated from Section 8)
  - Tools like new_task for Engage phase
  - Workflow: GEM → Kilo YAML → Regen script → Custom modes (e.g., switch_mode for C2 passes)
  - SwarmLord Role: Parity with Orchestrator + GEM adherence (stigmergy appends on completion, recursive blackboard queries)
  - Implementation: Add to regen script (parse Section 8 YAML → Kilo instructions)
- **Status:** L0 SwarmLord first, iterate to full pod
- **Bridge:** Kilo custom navigator → LangGraph import (SqliteSaver persist)

**2. Inherited from Pass 13 (No Changes):**
- Pain #13 (Lossy Compression Death Spiral) — ROOT CAUSE addressed
- Fractal Holonic Workflow Architecture — HIVE→GROWTH→SWARM→PREY nested
- TTao Human Quotes Preserved — Oct 21, 2025 workshop session
- PREY Fully Operationalized — Distributed MAPE-K/OODA execution layer
- Software Catalog Schema — 4 singletons defined + regeneration rules
- 3 Conflated Problems SEPARATED — YAML/Interception/Catalog
- OBSIDIAN roles (replaces SIEGCSE) — 8 roles, 43% cognitive load ↓
- Layer 9 (Stigmergy) + Layer 10 (Post-Summary Gate) — Mandatory checks
- RESEARCH PARITY ACHIEVED — 71% vs pretrained DDPG, academic pub ready

---

### Human Insight Preservation (TTao Quotes - Oct 21, 2025)

**Purpose:** Preserve TTao's architectural vision in his own words (prevent AI reinterpretation drift)

**Context:** Oct 21, 2025 workshop session - Clarifying fractal holonic workflow architecture

**Key Quotes:**

1. **On Hierarchical Nesting:**
   > _"Hierarchical nested structures...HIVE contains GROWTH contains SWARM contains PREY...fractal holonic design. Each role can read and write stigmergy with clean handoffs."_
   
   **Meaning:** Each workflow level CONTAINS lower levels (not just sequenced), fractal self-similarity

2. **On PREY as Execution Layer:**
   > _"It's essentially a distributed MAPE-K or an OODA Loop. So it can do a lot. But it's more about the execution level."_
   
   **Meaning:** PREY is THE workhorse (most work happens here), sufficient for most autonomous operation

3. **On Mutation vs Evolution:**
   > _"Mutation archetype...all of the above + more. Small variations like flanking vs rush."_
   
   **Meaning:** SWARM Mutate = tactical-level QD (playbook variants), NOT vision-level evolution

4. **On Best-in-Class Niche Specialization:**
   > _"Best-in-Class Niche...like Swiss Army Knife has a corkscrew AND scissors AND knife, but if you ONLY need knives, specialized chef's knife beats it."_
   
   **Meaning:** HIVE Evolve = MAP-Elites QD creates niche specialists that beat universal under constraints

5. **On Time Scale Relativism:**
   > _"Time scales are relative not absolute...fastest → fast → slow → slowest, not seconds/minutes/hours."_
   
   **Meaning:** Don't hardcode durations (PREY might be milliseconds in simulation, minutes in human interaction)

6. **On Holonic Independence:**
   > _"Each level functions independently BUT contributes to others (whole/part duality)."_
   
   **Meaning:** Not pure hierarchy (command/control), each level has autonomy + coordination

7. **On Documentation Priority:**
   > _"For now as long as we have a good prey cycle it should be good enough for us to do most things. It's more about the execution level."_
   
   **Meaning:** PREY fully operationalized = sufficient, SWARM/GROWTH/HIVE role mappings can wait

**Drift Prevention:** If AI rewrites these sections, check against TTao's original quotes (ground truth)

## What Is GEM GENE SEED 01?

This is the **complete instruction set** for regenerating Hive Fleet Obsidian from first principles. Give this document to any LLM in any IDE and it can rebuild HFO at whatever level your resources support (L0→L1→L2→L3).

**Key Innovation:** Work **UPSTREAM** (this GEM document) and regenerate **DOWNSTREAM** (code, tests, infrastructure) automatically. Single source of truth eliminates drift.

**Apex/Exemplar Design:** HFO adopts **BEST-in-class patterns from ANY domain** (biological, industrial, academic, open source). Every component maps to proven precedents: biological organs (immune system, sleep consolidation), military doctrine (JADC2, Mosaic Warfare), evolutionary algorithms (Quality Diversity), distributed systems (stigmergy, CRDT). **Zero invention** — if it's battle-tested and mission-fit, HUNT how to integrate it.

**Validation:** PettingZoo MPE2-simple-tag with ≥90% catch rate is ground truth. If test passes, system works. If test fails, system is broken (no debate).

**Pass 14 Focus:** Kilo Code integration as intermediary to LangGraph, enabling custom modes for SwarmLord (orchestrator parity with PREY embedding).

---

## How to Use This GEM (Quickstart)

### If You're a Human (TTao)
1. **Start here:** Read Lines 1-120 (this inoculation section)
2. **Understand mission:** Section 0 (Life Economics, why HFO exists)
3. **Pick your level:** L0 (1 agent, manual) vs L1 (10 agents, automated)
4. **Follow Section 7:** Regeneration Protocol (step-by-step build instructions)
5. **Validate:** PettingZoo ≥90% catch rate (Section 5.6)

### If You're an AI Assistant
1. **ALWAYS read Lines 1-120 FIRST** (non-negotiable context)
2. **Query blackboard BEFORE status claims** (Layer 9: Stigmergy)
3. **HUNT precedents BEFORE inventing** (Rule #3: Apex/Exemplar)
4. **Update GEM BEFORE code** (Rule #1: Upstream → Downstream)
5. **Verify with PettingZoo** (Rule #7: Metrics over feelings)
6. **After summarization:** Run Layer 10 checklist (Pain #11 prevention)

### If You're a New AI Session
1. **Read:** `gems/ACTIVE_GEM1.md` (points to this file)
2. **Read:** `rituals/daily_todo/🕸⛰☑️🥇_UNIFIED_TODO_Pass14_20251022.md` (current work)
3. **Query:** `blackboard/🕸⛰🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl` (last 100 events)
4. **Check:** `ps aux | grep monitor` (verify automation running)
5. **Continue:** From last uncompleted task in TODO (don't restart work)

---

## Common Pitfalls (Anti-Patterns to Avoid)

### ❌ Don't: Hallucinate Status
**Problem:** AI says "✅ Done" without verifying  
**Solution:** Query blackboard, run `ps aux`, check files before claiming completion

### ❌ Don't: Invent Roles
**Problem:** Create "Scouters", "Innovators", "Explorers" (forbidden SIEGCSE drift)  
**Solution:** Use ONLY OBSIDIAN 8 roles (Observers to Navigators)

### ❌ Don't: Skip HUNT Step
**Problem:** Invent novel algorithms/patterns without researching precedents  
**Solution:** HUNT biological/industrial/academic/open-source best-in-class FIRST

### ❌ Don't: Work Downstream First
**Problem:** Create code/scripts without updating GEM  
**Solution:** Update GEM → Regenerate downstream (single source of truth)

### ❌ Don't: Optimize Prematurely
**Problem:** Over-engineer before validating with PettingZoo  
**Solution:** 80/20 rule — "Good enough" ships, "perfect" never does

### ❌ Don't: Trust Post-Summary Memory
**Problem:** After summarization, AI forgets tools/MCP/automation exist  
**Solution:** Run Layer 10 checklist AFTER EVERY summary (Pain #11 prevention)

## Section 2: Multi-Horizon Workflow Architecture (Fractal Holonic Design)

**Pass 14 Update:** Inherited from Pass 13, no changes (Kilo integration in Section 8)

**TTao Quote (Oct 21, 2025):** _"Hierarchical nested structures...HIVE contains GROWTH contains SWARM contains PREY...fractal holonic design. Each role can read and write stigmergy with clean handoffs."_

**TTao Quote (Oct 21, 2025):** _"It's essentially a distributed MAPE-K or an OODA Loop. So it can do a lot. But it's more about the execution level."_ (referring to PREY)

**Key Architectural Principle:** Each higher-level workflow CONTAINS multiple lower-level workflows (fractal self-similarity + holonic whole/part)

**Holonic Property:** Each level is simultaneously:
- **WHOLE:** Contains and orchestrates lower-level workflows
- **PART:** Contributes to higher-level workflows
- **INDEPENDENT:** Functions autonomously with own positive reinforcement loop
- **CONTRIBUTORY:** Feeds learning upward (bottom-up) and receives guidance downward (top-down)

**Stigmergy Handoff Pattern (PREY):**
1. **Observer** (Perceive) writes: `{"role":"observer","next_role":"bridger","data":{...}}`
2. **Bridger** (React) reads Observer → writes: `{"role":"bridger","prev_role":"observer","next_role":"shaper","data":{...}}`
3. **Shaper** (Engage) reads Bridger → writes: `{"role":"shaper","prev_role":"bridger","next_role":"analyzer","data":{...}}`
4. **Analyzer** (Yield) reads Shaper → writes: `{"role":"analyzer","prev_role":"shaper","cycle_complete":"PREY_quad","data":{...}}`

**PettingZoo Example (MPE2-simple-tag):**
```python
# PREY cycle in predator-prey game
observation = perceive(env)              # P - Observer
decision = react(observation, knowledge) # R - Bridger
action = engage(decision)                # E - Shaper
result = yield_outcome(action)           # Y - Analyzer

if result.caught_prey:
    knowledge.update("+1 success", tactic=action.type)  # Good yield
else:
    knowledge.update("+1 failure", tactic=action.type)  # Bad yield

# Next cycle uses accumulated knowledge (positive reinforcement)
```

### OBSIDIAN Roles (8 Total - JADC2 Aligned)

**Source:** Pass 1 JADC2 alignment + Oct 2025 IAN extension

**Design Date:** 2025-10-20 (Pass 12), Standardized 2025-10-21 (Pass 13)  
**Status:** 🟢 OBSID Core Complete (5 roles) | 🟡 IAN Extension Defined (3 roles - pending implementation)

**Architecture Decision:** OBSIDIAN nomenclature (project branding, 4 syllables, 43% cognitive load reduction vs SIEGCSE)

**Military Precedent:** JADC2 (Joint All-Domain Command & Control) Mosaic Warfare
- Observers → Bridgers → Shapers = Classic military kill chain (Sense → Make Sense → Act)
- Immunizers + Disruptors = Blue Team / Red Team split (force protection vs adversarial testing)
- Infusers + Analyzers + Navigators = Logistics + BDA + Strategic C2

**Core Pattern Identified:**
- **Triad 1:** Observers → Bridgers → Shapers (sense → integrate → act) = JADC2 kill chain
- **Pair:** Immunizers + Disruptors (defense + offense, blue + red) = Force protection duality
- **Triad 2:** Infusers → Analyzers → Navigators (sustain → assess → coordinate) = Backend functions

| **Navigators** | Strategic Orchestration (multi-swarm coordination) | Mosaic reconfiguration, routing | JP-5-0 (Joint Planning) | ANT-TASK-ALLOC (Ant Tasks) | 🟡 |

**Design Notes:**
- **Shapers** chosen over "Strikers" (softer, covers all effector actions: build, heal, move, communicate, not just strikes)
- **Infusers** maps to Circulatory organ (blood flow, nutrient transport) and JADC2 sustainment (logistics)
- **Analyzers** maps to F3EAD Analyze step (intelligence processing) and JADC2 BDA (effectiveness scoring)
- **Navigators** adds L1+ capability (multi-swarm routing, cost optimization: GPT-4 vs Claude selection, strategic planning)

**Playbook ID Standard (Oct 2025):**
- **Primary:** Military doctrine (ATP/JP) — 40+ years battle-tested, authoritative sources
- **Secondary:** Hybrid (biological/academic) — Zero invention, apex precedents from nature/industry
- **Format:** Each role gets 2 playbooks (Primary for main doctrine, Secondary for adaptive pattern)
- **Rationale:** Rule #3 (Hunt Apex/Exemplar) — Adopt from best-in-class, never invent

**Options Under Consideration:**
1. **Military Doctrine** (ATP/FM/JP) - Pure JADC2 alignment
   - Example: Observers → `ATP-3-55` (ISR/Information Collection)
2. **Hybrid** (Military + Industry + Bio) - Best-of-breed per role
   - Example: Observers → `ACO-SCOUT-001` (Ant colony scout behavior)
3. **NIST CSF** (Cybersecurity Framework) - Industry standard
   - Example: Observers → `DE.CM-1` (Detect: Continuous Monitoring)

**Research Document:** `chaos/20251020T070000Z_HUNT_PLAYBOOK_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`

**Decision Required:** User must select naming convention before playbook IDs finalized

**Implementation Timeline:**
- [ ] User selects Option 1, 2, 3, or custom approach
- [ ] Document provenance (cite source for each playbook ID)
- [ ] Update all references in Pass 14
- [ ] Create alias mapping (old → new) for transition
- [ ] Update Guardian to recognize new playbook IDs

**Constraint:** NO playbook IDs finalized until adopted from industry/military/biological precedents

**Forbidden Roles (AI Slop - Never Use):**
- ❌ Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers
- These crept in via AI hallucination (Pass 10 drift)
- Not JADC2-aligned, not battle-tested
- Guardian blocks commits if detected
