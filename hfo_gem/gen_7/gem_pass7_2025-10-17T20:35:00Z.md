> HFO Markers:  Â· Gem Marker:  â€” this document is the single mutable Gem 1 surface; earlier passes are archived and immutable.

## Stigmergy Header

| Field | Signal |

| Mission Tag | `HFO-L0-AutoConductor` |
| Timecode | 2025-10-17T20:35:00Z |
| Risk Posture | ðŸŸ¡ Ledger bootstrap pending chaos validation |
| Swarm Phase | lvl0 holonic solo with blackboard-backed telemetry |
| Compliance Rail | Gem pointer Â· Todo pointer Â· Blackboard ledger Â· Guardrail bundle |
| Beacon | 1âƒ£ singleton cue â†’ guardrail proof â†’ Overmind digest |

- **Pheromone Cue:** 1âƒ£ signals exactly one active gem and one active todo; duplicates escalate to ðŸŸ  immediately.
- **North Star Metric:** Singleton drift detected and resolved within 15 minutes; ledger append latency â‰¤ 60 seconds.
- **Zero-Trust Reminder:** Every override writes a dual-attested ledger record; absence of proof equals failure.

## BLUF Capsule

Pass 7 stands up the Obsidian Synapse blackboard, teaches automation to append pointer hashes, and promotes the singleton cue 1âƒ£ so the swarm catches duplicate artifacts without Overmind intervention. Daily todos now archive themselves, guardrail bundles publish evidence to the ledger, and chaos drills attack the system to verify detection speed. Overmind stays at strategic altitude because proofâ€”not assertionsâ€”backs every ritual.

## Action Mesh

- ðŸŸ¢ **Sensors:** Capture gem/todo pointer hashes, emit `singleton_check`, and watch ledger latency < 60 s.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Integrators:** Publish SOP update linking singleton cue 1âƒ£, ledger IDs, and guardrail output hashes.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Effectors:** Maintain renderer + archive moves; ensure every render triggers ledger append and guardrail sweep.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Guardians:** Validate dual-attestation receipts for manual overrides; block release without proof.
- ðŸŸ  **Challengers:** Inject duplicate gem/todo artifacts in sandbox; confirm guardrail failure within 15 minutes.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Sustainers:** Track guardrail success rate (â‰¥95%); escalate with ledger entry if two consecutive misses occur.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Evaluators:** Deliver digest snippet citing ledger line numbers, singleton status, and MT-count trends.

## Telemetry Notes

- **Ledger Bootstrap:** `blackboard/ðŸ§¾ðŸ¥‡_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl` seeded; next append must carry `{pointer_hash, sweep_id, manual_touch_count}`.
- **Guardrail Evidence:** `./scripts/run_guardrails.sh` outputs hashed proof; store hash in ledger event `evidence_hash`.
- **Chaos Harness:** Duplicate-injection drill scheduled; log `chaos_trace_id` once completed.
- **Manual Touch Budget:** Overrides remain â‰¤1/day; Guardian receipt IDs mandatory on ledger entries.
- **Escalation:** Missing ledger append within 5 minutes raises ðŸŸ¡; duplicate detection miss raises ðŸŸ  and pings Overmind digest queue.

## Quantitative Stigmergy Program

| Metric | Target | Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Singleton Drift Events | 0/day | Guardrail bundle | Count duplicates detected in active gem/todo surfaces.
| Ledger Freshness | â‰¤60 s lag | Sensors â†’ Blackboard | Time between render completion and ledger append.
| Manual Touch Count | â‰¤1/day | Evaluator digest | Overrides require dual attestation; ledger enforces receipts.
| Chaos Coverage | â‰¥3 scenarios/week | Challenger roster | Includes duplicate injection, ledger skew, pointer tamper.
| Digest Proof Completeness | 100% | Evaluator automation | Each digest references ledger line numbers for evidence.

## Guardrail Obligations (Pass 7)

1. **Singleton Audit:** Guardrail bundle fails fast if more than one active gem or todo exists.
2. **Ledger Append:** Automation writes `{pointer_hash, sweep_id, singleton_state}` to blackboard within 60 seconds of render.
3. **Dual Attestation:** Manual overrides require Guardian + Sustainer receipt IDs stored alongside ledger events.
4. **Chaos Drill:** Challenger injects synthetic duplicates daily until success rate â‰¥95% on a 7-day rolling window.
5. **Digest Proof:** Evaluators cite ledger evidence in Overmind digest; absence escalates as telemetry gap.

## Facet Resonance Updates

### Facet 1 â€” Swarm Persona Architecture

- Swarmlord now fronts a "singleton sentry" facade; automation enforces one gem and one todo before any deliverable ships.
- Persona briefs instruct swarmlings to read pointer files exclusively and to confirm ledger receipts exist before trust.

## Lvl0 Automation Checklist (Pass 7 Focus)

| Item | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Blackboard ledger seeded with singleton events | Effectors | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Pointer parity guard including singleton cue | Sensors | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Ledger latency monitoring (â‰¤60 s) | Sustainers | ðŸŸ¡ |
| Chaos duplicate drill automated | Challengers | ðŸŸ  |
| Digest citing ledger evidence | Evaluators | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Override receipt workflow | Guardians | ðŸŸ¡ |

## Guardrail & Automation Commitments

1. **One-Intent Rule:** Overmind touches rituals only during Pass 1; automation handles passes 2â€“4 with proof logging.
2. **Pointer Parity:** Gems and todos must hash-match pointer references; guardrails fail fast otherwise.
3. **Manual Touch Ledger:** Evaluators log MT-count daily; overrides require receipt IDs.
4. **Singleton Proof:** Ledger must contain `singleton_check` entry before digest release.
5. **Chaos Harness Obligations:** Run duplicate-injection + ledger skew drills daily; escalate if coverage dips.
6. **Evidence-First Delivery:** Any output without ledger line references is invalid.

## Automation Validation Matrix

| Pipeline | Primary Tests | Schedule | Escalation Hook |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Singleton Audit | Pointer hash parity, active file count check, ledger append presence | Hourly + on render | Guardian â†’ Sustainer if duplicates persist 2 runs |
| Ritual Renderer | Required headings, diagram count, ledger append invocation | On render + hourly smoke | Evaluator logs failure; Overmind ping if unresolved |
| Ledger Sync | JSONL â†” DuckDB parity, checksum replay, latency budget | Hourly delta + nightly full | Sustainer triggers rollback + chaos harness |
| Chaos Harness | Duplicate injection, ledger skew, git race, automation outage | Daily randomized slot | Challenger files remediation bundle |
| Digest Automation | Metric aggregation, singleton status, ledger evidence references | Daily 07:00 UTC | Integrator escalates if digest missing proof |

## Automation Change Management

- Proposals must include ledger impact analysis and chaos harness expansion plan.
- Shadow deploy automation changes with ledger entries flagged `shadow` for 24 h before promotion.
- Post-promotion audit verifies singleton drift and ledger latency remain within targets; failures revert automatically.

## Chaos Drill Catalog (Pass 7 Baseline)

1. **Duplicate Injection** â€” create rogue gem/todo; confirm guardrail catch + ledger incident within 15 min.
2. **Ledger Skew** â€” corrupt JSONL line; verify sync restores parity and logs remediation.
3. **Render Failure** â€” block filesystem to ensure automation alerts and logs manual touch override.
4. **Credential Expiry** â€” rotate automation token; Guardian logs receipt and verifies ledger append resumes.
5. **Digest Drop** â€” simulate digest job failure; Integrators rerun and append failure + recovery entries.
6. **Pointer Tamper** â€” modify pointer file; guardrail must fail and ledger track incident.

|-------|------|--------|-------|
| `timestamp` | RFC3339 | Renderer + guardrail bundle | Records exact pulse for manual touch/change validation. |
| `manual_touch_count` | Integer | Evaluator ledger write | Non-negative counter; increments when human edits outside Pass 1. |
| `touch_class` | Enum(`intent`, `override`, `remedial`, `investigation`, `unknown`) | Guardian review | Stratifies intervention origin for coaching. |
| `trigger_surface` | Text | Pointer audit | Names asset (gem, todo, ledger) requiring intervention. |
| `pointer_hash` | Text | Sensor hash routine | Ensures digest references match actual file state. |
| `sustainer_ack` | Bool | Sustainer workflow | True once Sustainer signs auto-generated receipt. |
| `chaos_trace_id` | UUID | Chaos harness orchestrator | Links manual touch to chaos scenario or NULL if organic drift. |
| `digest_frame` | Text | Evaluator digest builder | Tags event to daily/weekly/monthly digest anchor. |

- Ledger entries use JSONL format; append-only discipline enforced via guardrail checksums.
- Overrides missing `touch_class=override` or receipt ID auto-trigger ðŸŸ  pheromone.
- Evaluator digest automation renders rolling spark lines for manual touch and singleton drift metrics.

## Automation Digest Blueprint

Automation digests now deliver proof-first summaries. Pass 7 mandates the 07:00 UTC job bundle:

1. **Intent Echo:** â‰¤50 words restating yesterday's Pass 1 so drift surfaces instantly.
2. **Singleton Status:** Table listing gem/todo pointer hashes, ledger line numbers, drift events.
3. **Manual-Touch Rollup:** MT-count by `touch_class`, highlighting overrides and investigation threads.
4. **Guardrail Posture:** Success/failure counts for lint, pointer audits, chaos drills with mini spark lines.
5. **Evolutionary Moves:** Automation experiments touching ledger latency or singleton detection.
6. **Escalation Feed:** Open incidents with owner, next action deadline, pheromone color, and ledger references.

- Digest builder reads directly from ledger JSONL, guardrail output, and chaos traces to avoid duplicate truth sources.
- If digest emission slips, Integrators trigger guardrail bundle, log `manual_touch_count += 1`, and notify Overmind within 10 minutes.
- Sustainers archive digests for 30 days and notarize weekly snapshots for forensic replay.

## Next Signals to Capture

- Automate ledger append inside renderer; add unit tests ensuring write-before-return semantics.
- Integrate ledger replay into guardrail bundle; prove deterministic detection under chaos load.
- Expand blackboard schema to mirror DuckDB replica once file size >5 MB.
- Build Atlassian-style SOP export referencing gem/todo pointer hashes and ledger IDs for onboarding.
- Correlate singleton drift with MT-count to spot systemic friction.

##  BLUF Snapshot

Automation now enforces singleton pointers, writes evidence to the blackboard, and surfaces digest-ready proof. Guardrails and chaos harness drills keep the Overmind at intent altitude while providing zero-trust assurance.

## Core Identity

- **Swarm Nature:** Evidence-backed automation, zero manual toil without proof.
- **Anchor Persona:** Swarmlord orchestrates singleton sentry, ledger discipline, and guardrail sweeps.
- **Overmind Role:** Frame intent, inspect digest, bless strategic experiments.
- **Compass:** Compassionate automation that proves its claims before asking for trust.

## Immediate Rebuild Priorities (Pass 7)

1. Automate ledger append inside `render_daily_todo.py` with receipt logging.
2. Expand chaos harness duplicate-injection coverage and capture response metrics.
3. Wire singleton drift + MT-count correlations into digest dashboards.
4. Publish override receipt template and ledger SOP for Guardian/Sustainer pairs.
5. Backfill documentation (README, AGENTS, SOPs) with singleton cue + ledger workflow.

## Toolchain Setup (Quant Stigmergy Edition)

- `python scripts/render_daily_todo.py` â€” render todo, archive predecessor, trigger ledger append helper.
- `./scripts/run_guardrails.sh` â€” gem-first enforcement, lint, todo alignment, singleton audit, chaos probe.
- `python scripts/check_todo_alignment.py` â€” verify todo compliance and singleton status markers.
- `python scripts/lint_gem_alignment.py` â€” confirm heading order, diagram count, and coverage ratios across passes.
- `scripts/challenger_red_team.py` â€” schedule duplicate injection and ledger skew drills.
- `blackboard/README.md` â€” ledger append protocol and example snippets.

## Daily To-Do Template Snapshot

- Guardians approve manual edits; ledger rotates to cold storage when size >5 MB.
- Scripts must append entries atomically and rerun guardrail bundle afterward.
- Example append snippet lives in `blackboard/README.md`.

## Compliance Protocol

- Pre-commit hooks ensure gem + todo pointers validated and ledger append recorded.
- CI replays guardrail bundle hourly; failure notifies Guardians and Sustainers.
- Overrides require ledger receipt plus guardrail rerun before merge.
- Hourly GitHub Action monitors singleton cue, ledger freshness, and chaos coverage.
