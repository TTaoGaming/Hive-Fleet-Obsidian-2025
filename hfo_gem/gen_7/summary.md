# Hive Fleet Obsidian â€” Gem 1 Generation 7 Summary

## Key Concepts
Generation 7 (Pass 7) of Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) hardens lvl0 with quantitative stigmergy, singleton sentries, and blackboard-led proof systems. Focus: Evidence over assertions, ensuring automation outputs verifiable ledger entries.

- **Singleton Cue (1âƒ£):** Enforces one active gem/todo; pointers (`gems/ACTIVE_GEM1.md`, `rituals/daily_todo/ACTIVE_TODO.md`) hash-match files. Duplicates trigger ðŸŸ  escalation.
- **Blackboard Ledger:** `blackboard/ðŸ§¾ðŸ¥‡_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl` seeded; appends `{pointer_hash, sweep_id, manual_touch_count}`. Mirror (`ðŸ§¾ðŸ¥ˆ_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.duckdb`) ensures parity via syncs.
- **Guardrail Evidence:** `./scripts/run_guardrails.sh` hashes outputs (`evidence_hash`); ledger events include sweep IDs for replay.
- **Chaos Drills:** Automated (`challenger_red_team.py`); inject duplicates/ledger skew/pointer tamper; daily, with `chaos_trace_id` logging.
- **Digest Proof:** Evaluator digests cite ledger lines/hashes; 100% completeness required, no blind summaries.

Risk: ðŸŸ¡ ledger bootstrap/chaos validation. North Star: Singleton drift â‰¤15 min resolution; ledger latency â‰¤60s.

## Evolutions from Prior Generations
Gen_7 evolves Gen_1-6's evidence systems, emphasizing proof-backed governance.

- **From Gen_1 (Pass 1):** Enhances facets (e.g., Facet 2 evolution) with ledger for case-based memory, evolving fail-better to proof-capture.
- **From Gen_2 (Pass 2):** Archives todos automatically, adding singleton cue to Gen_2's discipline, reducing manual archiving.
- **From Gen_3 (Pass 3):** Evolves blackboard with bootstrap (`{pointer_hash, sweep_id}`), addressing Gen_3's raw events via structured appends.
- **From Gen_4 (Pass 4):** Integrates pointers into singleton audits, evolving Gen_4's integrity to dual gem/todo enforcement.
- **From Gen_5 (Pass 5):** Builds on syncs with evidence hashes (`evidence_hash`), evolving Gen_5's parity to include sweep IDs.
- **From Gen_6 (Pass 6):** Graduates MT-telemetry to singleton focus, adding cue 1âƒ£ for proactive detection; evolves Gen_6's sweeps to include validation.

Fan-out: Ledger schemas to lvl1 (replication across pods); converge: Gen_6 MT with singleton for comprehensive proof (citations/hashes).

Drift Check: "Ledger Bootstrap: next append must carry `{pointer_hash, sweep_id}`" â€” chaos drills test; no residuals, as bundles fail-closed on misses. Converges Gen_6's lag to ðŸŸ¡ validation.

## Connections to HFO Architecture & Lineage
Gen_7 reinforces HFO's proof-first ethos, linking to gems/lineage.

- **To Other Gems:** Seeds Gen_8 facade generation; singleton/ledger align with Gen_19 audits, canonicalizing governance.
- **HFO Integration:** Exoskeleton via evidence cartilage (reflexesâ†’cognition); liberation (drift-free rituals); war chest (singleton prevents skew). Lvl0 checklists gate lvl10 (checkpoints).
- **Lineage Ties:** Biomimetic (HÃ¶lldobler 1990: trails for singleton; Dorigo 1996: decay in appends); NASA (receipts as flight rules); Atlassian (SOPs for evidence). Evolves Gen_1 QD (drill results seed memory), tying to RTS (probes as simulations).

Gen_7 converges Gen_6's minimization into proof-backed lvl0, fanning verifiable HFO. Word count: 356.
