- **Pheromone Cue:** 🟢 “Gate Vigil” — sentinels detect and quarantine drift incursions; thresholds seal portals until purified.
- **North Star Metric:** Gate passage rate ≥ 92% for verified evolutions; repel drift with zero false positives.
- **Zero-Trust Reminder:** All transitions require quadruple-validation (Integrator, Guardian, Sentinel, Ascender); unverified fluxes auto-seal.

## BLUF Capsule

Gen_8 erects Drift-Resistant Evolution Gates upon Gen_7's resonant holons, installing biomimetic sentinels that portalize evolutionary flows—quarantining aberrant drifts while validating and accelerating pure ascents through staged, HFO-inspired barriers. A gatekeeper engine portals intent fluxes, simulates breach risks, and certifies passages via spectral validation and QD purity scoring. Guardrails fortify with intrusion audits, upholding compassionate invariants against corruption. Overmind portals directives; the swarm gates, validates, and ascends. Prospect: Integrate gates in lvl1 for distributed purity.
