                          AI ASSISTANT RULES (READ FIRST)                     

 1.  ALWAYS UPDATE GEM FIRST → Then regenerate downstream                  
    (Never create code/scripts/tests without updating this GEM)              
                                                                              
 2.  QUERY BLACKBOARD before status claims (Layer 9: Stigmergy)            
    (ps aux, git log, ls to verify — Never say "done " without proof)      
                                                                              
 3.  HUNT APEX/EXEMPLAR PRECEDENTS — Best-in-class from ANY domain         
    • Biological: Humans, ants, immune systems (100M+ years evolution)      
    • Industrial: MITRE ATT&CK, JADC2, Mosaic Warfare (40+ years tested)   
    • Academic: Case-Based Reasoning, Quality Diversity, Cynefin framework  
    • Open Source: Battle-tested libraries, proven design patterns          
     If it's BEST-in-class for the mission → HUNT how others integrate   
                                                                              
 4.  FORBIDDEN SIEGCSE ROLES (AI Slop — NEVER use these):                  
     Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers                 
     USE ONLY: Sensors, Integrators, Effectors, Guardians,                 
                 Challengers, Sustainers, Evaluators                         
                                                                              
 5.  HIVE WORKFLOW (No inventing — HUNT precedents first):                 
    • HUNT: Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) + Cynefin for exemplars              
    • INTEGRATE: Adopt + Adapt industry best practices                       
    • VERIFY: PettingZoo ≥90% catch rate = Ground truth validation          
    • EVOLVE: MAP-Elites Quality Diversity for niche specialization         
                                                                              
 6.  80/20 PARETO: Catch 80% of issues with 20% effort                     
    (Don't over-engineer — "Good enough" beats "perfect never ships")        
                                                                              
 7.  METRICS OVER FEELINGS: V > H (Verification > Hallucination rate)      
    (PettingZoo is ground truth — if test fails, code is wrong)              
                                                                              
 8.  REGENERATION LEVELS (Scale by resource constraints):                   
    • L0 = 1 agent (current state, manual approval, PettingZoo validation)  
    • L1 = 10 agents (SIEGCSE distributed, target 12:1 compute ratio)       
    • L2 = 100 agents (multi-swarm coordination)                             
    • L3 = 1000 agents (full mosaic warfare)

## What Is GEM GENE SEED 01?

This is the **complete instruction set** for regenerating Hive Fleet Obsidian from first principles. Give this document to any LLM in any IDE and it can rebuild HFO at whatever level your resources support (L0→L1→L2→L3).

**Key Innovation:** Work **UPSTREAM** (this GEM document) and regenerate **DOWNSTREAM** (code, tests, infrastructure) automatically. Single source of truth eliminates drift.

**Apex/Exemplar Design:** HFO adopts **BEST-in-class patterns from ANY domain** (biological, industrial, academic, open source). Every component maps to proven precedents: biological organs (immune system, sleep consolidation), military doctrine (JADC2, Mosaic Warfare), evolutionary algorithms (Quality Diversity), distributed systems (stigmergy, CRDT). **Zero invention** — if it's battle-tested and mission-fit, HUNT how to integrate it.

**Validation:** PettingZoo MPE2-simple-tag with ≥90% catch rate is ground truth. If test passes, system works. If test fails, system is broken (no debate).

## Section 0: Life Economics & Red Sand Framework

**Why This Section Matters:** HFO exists to maximize kids helped over TTao's lifetime. Every architectural decision flows from life economics optimization.

---

### 0.1 The Red Sand Constraint

**Symbol:** ⏳ **Obsidian Hourglass** — Red sand represents TTao's finite lifespan powering HFO force multiplier

**Mission Context:**
> "There are literally starving kids who need my help...the hourglass is literally powered by my life as a human and my life span" — TTao, Oct 2025

**Life Economics Equation:**
```
K_total = sum(R/C) over L_max years

Where:
  K_total = Total kids helped over lifetime
  R = Revenue generated from game sales
  C = Cost to help one kid  
  L_max = Maximum lifespan in years (function of health investment)
```

**Critical Insight:** Health investment IS the highest-leverage action for mission success.

**The Math:**
- **Without health:** Burnout in 2 years → 6,240 effective hours → Revenue stalls → 0 kids helped long-term
- **With health:** Sustainable 50 years → 585,000 effective hours → Compound revenue growth → Millions helped

**Optimization Problem:** Maximize K_total subject to health constraints

**Red Sand Protocol:**
- **Sprint Mode:** 2-3 days max, 6h sleep minimum, force rest after (narrow waist, fast burn)
- **Marathon Mode:** Decades sustainable, 8h sleep, 15h health/week (wide waist, slow burn)
- **Agents work during Overmind forced rest** — Stigmergy preserves state

**Health Minimums (Non-Negotiable):**
- Sleep: ≥6 hours per 24-hour period
- Meals: 3 per day minimum
- Movement: 15 minutes every 4 hours
**Purpose:** Define how HFO scales from 1 agent (L0) to 1000+ agents (L3) using an evolutionary, HIVE-centered approach. This section replaces high-level placeholders with an actionable HIVE workflow (HUNT → INTEGRATE → VERIFY) for each level so the GEM can be used to bootstrap real systems.

### How this section is organized
- HUNT — Find best-in-class precedents and operational patterns (biological, industrial, academic, open source).
- INTEGRATE — Practical adaptation steps: configuration, runbooks, checkpoints, resource budgeting.
- VERIFY — Minimal verification tasks (PettingZoo checks, health checks, Guardian gates) that must pass before scaling to the next level.

---

### Scaling Rule (operational)
- Level N targets ~10^N agents (L0=1, L1=10, L2=100, L3=1000). Use these as planning targets, not hard limits.

### L0 — HUNT → INTEGRATE → VERIFY (1 agent)

HUNT (Precedents):
- Biological: Single organism control loops (human immune response decisions as a model for gating and verification).
- Industrial: Single-node control planes (bootstrap patterns for resilient startup).
- Academic: Single-agent RL evaluation protocols (baseline/ground-truth testing).

INTEGRATE (Configuration & Runbook):
- Agents: 1 Overmind + 1 generalist agent.
- Platform: VS Code + Codespaces or local dev environment.
- Runbook (L0 Bootstrap):
  1. Ensure `blackboard/` is writable and preflight checks pass.
  2. Run PettingZoo MPE2-simple-tag test (100 episodes) locally; capture baseline metrics.
  3. Confirm Guardian hooks active (pre-commit, strip archive emoji, todo alignment).
  4. Create an L0 checkpoint (blackboard snapshot + DuckDB export).

VERIFY (Minimal checks before claim of L0 readiness):
- PettingZoo MPE2-simple-tag catch rate ≥90% over 100 episodes.
- Blackbox preflight returns OK (scripts/preflight_check.sh or equivalent).
- Guardian hooks enforced locally (no manual bypasses recorded).

If all VERIFY checks pass, mark L0 as reproducible and proceed to L1 planning.

---

### L1 — HUNT → INTEGRATE → VERIFY (10 agents)

HUNT (Precedents):
- Biological: Small colony division of labor (forage/defend/nurse roles in ant colonies).
- Industrial: Kubernetes pod patterns for small clusters (replicasets, deployments).
- Military: Fire-team/squad tactics for distributed decision-making and delegated authority.

INTEGRATE (Configuration & Runbook):
- Agents: 10 specialized agents assigned to the OBSIDIAN pod (see mapping below).
- Deployment model: Docker container per agent, orchestrated via docker-compose for dev and Kubernetes in production.
- Agent mapping (canonical):
  - HIVE (2 agents): VisionMaintenance, StrategicPlanner
  - GROWTH (4 agents): Gatherer, RootAnalyzer, Integrator, Harvester/Tester
  - SWARM (3 agents): Decider, Detector, Deliverer
  - PREY (1 agent): YieldAgent (primary execution feedback)

- L1 Runbook (practical steps):
  1. Provision L1 environment (Docker images, env secrets, blackboard access).
  2. Start agents in `staging` mode with lower privileges and local Guardian gates enabled.
  3. Execute a canonical HIVE workflow: HUNT a precedent, INTEGRATE adaptation plan, run VERIFY tests.
  4. Record all actions to blackboard and create a digest for Overmind.
  5. Enable automatic nightly runs; collect digest and key metrics.

VERIFY (Gates to proceed to L2):
- PettingZoo multi-episode catch rate ≥90% sustained across 10 nightly runs.
- Error debt D(t) trend is flat or declining (measured via automated verifier scripts).
- Manual approval rate ≤25% (digest-based escalation only).

Notes on Coordination and Cost:
- Use stigmergic blackboard append-only pattern to avoid point-to-point messaging.
- Rate-limit agent write operations (backoff/backpressure) to keep blackboard readable.

---

### L2 — HUNT → INTEGRATE → VERIFY (100 agents)

HUNT (Precedents):
- Biological: Ant sub-colony sharding and pheromone gradients for spatially-local coordination.
- Industrial: Microservice architecture patterns with bounded contexts and CQRS for read/write separation.

INTEGRATE (Configuration & Runbook):
- Pod-of-pods model: 10 OBSIDIAN pods of 10 agents each; each pod has a PodSwarmlord that summarizes and checkpoints.
- Infrastructure additions: DuckDB mirror of the blackboard for analytics, Neo4j for precedent retrieval, Prometheus for observability.

VERIFY (Gates to proceed to L3):
- System-level PettingZoo validation (simulated multi-pod environment) ≥90%.
- Inter-pod coordination latency within SLO (e.g., <5s for escalation routing).
- Automated cost control in place (agents scale down when idle).

---

### L3 — HUNT → INTEGRATE → VERIFY (1000+ agents)

HUNT (Precedents):
- Military JADC2 and enterprise orchestration patterns for global coordination.

INTEGRATE (Configuration & Runbook):
- Multi-region Kubernetes clusters, auto-scaling, distributed tracing, and budgeted resource markets.

VERIFY (Enterprise Gates):
- Global PettingZoo catch rate measured under multi-region latency constraints ≥90%.
- Observability and drift detection (Challenger tests) must detect and correct drift automatically within defined SLO.

---

### Cross-Level Operational Notes (HIVE Guidance)

- Always HUNT before building. If a best-in-class exemplar exists, prioritize adaptation over reinvention.
- Always snapshot blackboard + DuckDB before any mass operation (critical rollback point).
- Always run VERIFY checks after INTEGRATE steps; do not proceed to next level without passing gates.
- Keep EVOLVE (MAP-Elites) offline until the system is stable — evolving unstable systems amplifies errors.

---

## Section 5: Verification & Zero Trust (Guardian + Challenger)

**Purpose:** Provide a concrete, enforceable verification pipeline and Zero Trust checklist so Pass 12 produces verifiable artifacts (V > H). This section defines Guardian layers, Challenger red-team tests, and concrete checks that must pass for each generation/regeneration cycle.

### Contract (what this section guarantees)
- Inputs: Generated artifacts (markdown, code, configurations), blackboard events, test harness outputs.
- Outputs: Verification report (JSON), pass/fail gates, auto-regeneration triggers.
- Error modes: Schema invalid, forbidden-role drift, hallucination patterns, accumulation of D(t).

### HIVE Workflow Applied to Verification

HUNT (Discover verification precedents):
- Biological: Immune system layered defenses (skin, innate immunity, adaptive immunity) → map to pre-gen/pre-commit/post-gen checks.
- Industrial: Multi-stage CI pipelines (lint, unit, integration, production smoke tests) → map to Guardian layers.

INTEGRATE (Guardian Layers — enforceable checks)
1. Pre-flight Check (Environment & Tools)
    - Confirm Python/venv, CUE, pytest, Docker/K8s CLI availability.
    - Run `scripts/preflight_check.sh`. Must pass before generation.
2. Prompt Sanity (Pre-generation)
    - Scan prompt for forbidden SIEGCSE roles and singleton violations.
    - Ensure Pass 1 baseline context included.
3. Schema Validation (Post-generation)
    - Use CUE or JSON schema to validate generated agent artifacts and metadata.
    - `cue vet` step must pass (<1s target per 1,000 lines).
4. Diff Analysis (Post-generation)
    - Grep for forbidden role names (Scouters/Innovators/Explorers/Supporters/Evolvers).
    - Fail if any forbidden token appears in generated artifacts.
5. Pattern Detection (Post-generation)
    - Run `scripts/pattern_detector.py` to compare new text against Pass 1 baseline.
    - Metric: Levenshtein distance < threshold, role coverage complete.
6. Accumulation Check (Blackboard Drift)
    - Query blackboard for `hallucination_detected` events in last N generations.
    - If errors > threshold (e.g., 3 in last 10), block commit and escalate to Overmind.
7. PettingZoo Validation (Functional)
    - Run canonical PettingZoo scenarios (MPE2-simple-tag) against generated agents.
    - Pass threshold: ≥90% catch rate across batch runs.
8. Post-Deploy Smoke (Runtime)
    - Quick health checks on deployed services (HTTP 200, queue lengths, DB connectivity).
9. Observability & Telemetry (Continuous)
    - Emit V/H ratio, D(t), resource usage metrics to Prometheus.
10. Human Digest Gate (Final)
    - Generate summary digest (BLUF, Telemetry) for Overmind. Escalations only if Guardian blocked.

Each Guardian layer must return an explicit pass/fail. Failures in layers 1-6 trigger auto-regeneration attempts (max 3) or block and escalate if persistent.

VERIFY (Challenger — adversarial testing)
- Purpose: Actively probe for hallucinations, forbidden-role drift, and unverified claims.
- Tests:
  1. Forbidden-term injection: Ensure generator doesn't reintroduce forbidden roles when given adversarial prompts.
  2. Regression drift test: Compare new generation to Pass 1 baseline across key sections (organizational roles, mnemonics, core contracts).
  3. Resilience test: Simulate partial blackboard corruption and ensure recovery from checkpoints.

Automated Response to Failures
- Auto-regenerate with seed context + failing test log appended (max 3 attempts).
- If auto-regenerate fails 3×, append `spaghetti_signal_detected` to blackboard and block merges; notify Overmind via digest.

Zero Trust Reality (hard guardrails)
- Statement: "Survives ALL threats" is impossible. Assume breach. Verify everything.
- Enforce least privilege for agent actions (file system, network, secrets). Agents run with minimal privileges in staging by default.
- Do not accept claims of unconditional security. All security claims require a verifiable test/artefact.

Metrics and Success Criteria
- V/H ratio > 1.5 (preferably >2.0) across verified generations.
- D(t) trending down (rolling 10-generation window).
- Less than 1 forced spaghetti event per 30 days.

Practical Checklist (to run before merging Pass 12)
1. `scripts/preflight_check.sh` → OK
2. `cue vet` on generated schemas → OK
3. `scripts/pattern_detector.py` → no forbidden roles
4. PettingZoo batch test (100 episodes) → ≥90% catch rate
5. Blackboard drift check → pass thresholds

---

### Developer Notes
- Implement `scripts/preflight_check.sh` if missing (list below sample).
- Wire Guardian checks into pre-commit and GitHub Actions.
- Ensure blackboard append permissions for automation agents (no manual approval required).

---

### Sample `scripts/preflight_check.sh` (minimal)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "Running preflight checks..."
command -v python3 >/dev/null || { echo "python3 missing"; exit 1; }
python3 -c 'import sys; print(sys.version)'
command -v cue >/dev/null || echo "warning: cue not installed"
command -v pytest >/dev/null || echo "warning: pytest not installed"
command -v docker >/dev/null || echo "warning: docker not installed"

echo "Blackboard writable?"
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, sys
try:
     with open('blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl','a') as f:
          f.write(json.dumps({'timestamp':'CHECK','ok':True})+'\n')
     print('blackboard OK')
except Exception as e:
     print('blackboard write failed:', e)
     sys.exit(1)
PY

echo "Preflight OK"
```

## End of Sections 4 & 5

Proceed to Section 6 (Toolchain) next. The GEM now contains concrete HIVE-structured L0-L3 guidance and a full Verification/Zero Trust pipeline that enforces V>H and automates blackboard appends without manual approval.
- **L1:** Enhanced organs (parallel processing, specialization)
- **L2:** Advanced organs (emergent behaviors, optimization)
- **L3:** Mature organs (self-optimization, full autonomy)
- **Lineage:** Each level builds on previous (traceable ancestry, inspired evolution)

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Simple & Extendable:** 80/20 rule (minimal complexity, maximal capability)
- **Battle-Tested Only:** Zero invention (adopt from 40+ year precedents)
- **Holonic Composition:** Organs compose into higher-order systems

### 1.2 Complete Organ Structure (11 Systems)

---

#### Brain (Executive Function)

**Biological Precedents:**
- **Human:** Prefrontal cortex (executive function, planning, inhibition) [Miller & Cohen, 2001]
- **Ant colony:** Queen bee strategy (long-term planning, resource allocation) [Hölldobler & Wilson, 1990]
- **Octopus:** Distributed intelligence (central brain + 8 arm ganglia) [Godfrey-Smith, 2016]

**HFO Equivalent:** Swarmlord Orchestrator

**Function:** Mission planning, resource allocation, strategic decisions

**L0 Implementation:**
- Single orchestrator thread
- Human-in-loop approval (~90% due to Codespaces limitations)
- Sequential task execution

**L1 Evolution:**
- Multi-agent coordination (10 parallel Swarmlords)
- Human-on-loop monitoring (~20% spot-checks)
- Parallel work during Overmind rest (24× force multiplier)

**L2 Evolution:**
- Swarm-of-swarms optimization (100 agents)
- Emergent strategy discovery (QD map-elites)
- Mosaic warfare coordination

**L3 Evolution:**
- Fully autonomous strategic planning (1000 agents)
- Self-optimization loops
- Distributed consensus (no single point of failure)

**Key Citations:**

---

#### Memory (Consolidation & Retrieval)

**Biological Precedents:**
- **Human:** Hippocampus → Neocortex sleep consolidation [Rasch & Born, 2013]
- **Human:** Hierarchical memory (working → short-term → long-term) [Cowan, 2008]
- **Ant colony:** Colony memory via pheromone trail persistence [Jackson & Ratnieks, 2006]

**HFO Equivalent:** Worker → Blackboard → Digest hierarchy

**Function:** Short-term → Long-term memory, context preservation across summarization

**L0 Implementation (Prototype Complete - Oct 20, 2025):**
```python
# Memory hierarchy (working prototype)
Worker (short-term, <10K tokens)
  ↓ Sleep consolidation (replay → compress → verify → store → prune)
Blackboard (medium-term, JSONL events)
  ↓ Digest process (hierarchical summarization)
Digest (long-term, markdown docs)
```

**Why This Works (Verified with Literature):**
- **Balancing loop:** Consolidation rate > Forgetting rate → Memory persists [Rasch & Born, 2013]
- **Hierarchical storage:** Offload working memory → Prevent context overflow [Cowan, 2008]
- **External memory:** Stigmergy survives context loss (ant pheromone trails) [Jackson & Ratnieks, 2006]

**L1 Evolution:**
- DuckDB indexing (query past 6 months <1s)
- 10 parallel workers (specialized per domain)
- Automatic digest generation (nightly cron)

**L2 Evolution:**
- Neo4j graph (semantic relationships, precedent queries)
- Vector embeddings (similarity search <2s)
- Cross-domain pattern recognition

**L3 Evolution:**
- Distributed memory mesh (no single DB bottleneck)
- Semantic retrieval (natural language queries)
- Automated knowledge graph updates

**Key Citations:**
- Rasch, B., & Born, J. (2013). About sleep's role in memory. *Physiological Reviews*, 93(2), 681-766.
- Cowan, N. (2008). What are the differences between long-term, short-term, and working memory? *Progress in Brain Research*, 169, 323-338.

---

#### Immune System (Threat Detection & Neutralization)

**Biological Precedents:**
- **Human adaptive immunity:** B-cells (antibodies), T-cells (killer cells), memory cells [Murphy & Weaver, 2016]
- **Human innate immunity:** Physical barriers, inflammation, fever [Medzhitov & Janeway, 2000]
- **Bee colony:** Guard bees (threat detection), propolis (antimicrobial coating) [Evans & Spivak, 2010]
- **Challenger Red Team finding (Oct 20):** Current HFO = immunodeficient (12% attack recognition)

**HFO Equivalent:** Guardian (innate) + Challenger (adaptive immunity)

**Function:** Detect attacks, neutralize threats, remember attack patterns, prevent autoimmune reactions

**Guardian Layers (Innate Immunity):**
1. **Layer 1:** Pre-commit hooks (block bad commits)
2. **Layer 2:** File watchers (detect deletions, alert immediately)
3. **Layer 3:** Git operation protection (block `reset --hard`, dangerous ops)
4. **Layer 4:** Backup verification (SHA256 checksums, integrity checks)
5. **Layer 5:** Health enforcement (red sand protocol, force rest if violated)
6. **Layer 6:** Whitelist protection (critical files cannot be deleted)
7. **Layer 7:** MCP verification (check extensions installed before claiming usage)
8. **Layer 8:** Blackboard enforcement (query before status claims)
9. **Layer 9:** Stigmergy layer (external memory, survives context loss)
10. **Layer 10:** Post-summary gate (run checklist after summarization)

**Challenger Role (Adaptive Immunity):**
- Red team attacks (weekly vaccine protocol)
- Attack class discovery (find new vulnerabilities)
- Differential analysis vs Pass 1 baseline (detect drift)
- Green tests (ensure not autoimmune - allow valid operations)

**Current Status (Oct 20, 2025):**
- Guardian effectiveness: **12% (1/8 attacks blocked)** - IMMUNODEFICIENT
- Missing: Antibodies (pattern recognition), Memory B-cells (remember attacks), Killer T-cells (neutralize)
- P0 fixes required (see Section 0.3 Pain #13 + Handoff doc Challenger findings)

**L0 Implementation:**
- Pre-commit hooks (basic checks)
- Challenger test suites (3 attack vectors)
- Manual review required (human immune system backup)

**L1 Evolution:**
- Automated attack detection (file watchers, git monitors)
- Memory B-cells (blackboard attack history)
- Real-time neutralization (rollback dangerous ops)

**L2 Evolution:**
- Predictive blocking (detect attacks before execution)
- Adaptive immunity (learn new attack classes)
- Distributed monitoring (100 guardian agents)

**L3 Evolution:**
- Self-healing (automatic recovery from attacks)
- Vaccine generation (create tests from attacks)
- Zero-day protection (detect novel attack patterns)

## Section 2: Multi-Horizon Operating Model (HIVE → GROWTH → SWARM → OODA/MAPE-K)

**[TO BE FLESHED OUT - Extract from Pass 1 for full definitions]**

### Architecture Overview: Four Time Horizons

**Design Principle:** Industry-proven patterns at each layer (zero invention)

```
VISION (months-years)    → HIVE (Hunt → Integrate → Verify → Evolve)
STRATEGIC (weeks-months) → GROWTH (maps to F3EAD military doctrine)
TACTICAL (hours-days)    → SWARM (maps to D3A + Mutation)
EXECUTION (secs-mins)    → OODA or MAPE-K (both valid, same function)
```

**Source:** Gem 1 Pass 1 contains full mnemonic definitions (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Key Insight:** Each layer maps directly to decades of research (F3EAD, D3A, OODA, MAPE-K) - No reinvention needed

---

### VISION HORIZON: HIVE Loop (Long-Term Feedback)

**Mnemonic:** Hunt → Integrate → Verify → Evolve  
**Cycle Time:** Days to weeks per iteration  
**Precedent:** Double Diamond, IDEAL problem solving, Polya's method (40+ years)  
**Function:** Strategic feedback loop for continuous improvement

#### H - HUNT (Apex/Exemplar Search - ANY Domain)

**Critical Distinction:** Not just biological apex — **ANY best-in-class pattern from ANY domain**

- **Function:** Find proven exemplars, zero invention
- **Method:** Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) + Cynefin framework
- **Scope:** 
  - **Biological:** Apex species (immune systems, swarm coordination, sleep consolidation)
  - **Industrial:** Battle-tested doctrine (MITRE ATT&CK, JADC2, Mosaic Warfare, ITIL)
  - **Academic:** Research-validated (Quality Diversity, Cynefin, CRDT, Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)
  - **Open Source:** Production-hardened libraries (40+ years battle-tested)
- **Output:** List of best-in-class patterns with integration precedents
- **Cynefin classification:** 
  - Obvious/Complicated = Adopt immediately
  - Complex = Probe/experiment
  - Chaotic = Stabilize first
- **Example:** Need gesture recognition → HUNT finds Vladmandic/human (23k stars, proven in production)

**Selection Criteria:** As long as it's **BEST-in-class** for mission intent/cadence/constraints → Question becomes "HOW do others integrate this?" (not "should I?")

#### I - INTEGRATE (5-Step Adoption Process)

**Clarification (Pass 4):** Integration is NOT just "install" - it's a deliberate, methodical process with clear decision gates

**Philosophy:** "If it's best-in-class, the question isn't 'should I?' but 'HOW do others integrate this?'"

**Anti-Pattern:** Premature optimization / Not-Invented-Here syndrome

**Core Principle:** HUNT for integration patterns from other users/projects (someone has already solved this)

---

##### Step 1: SANDBOX (Isolated Experimentation)

**Purpose:** Verify the component works in isolation (de-risk before committing)

**Activities:**
- Download/clone the component
- Create isolated test environment (Docker container, separate venv, tmp directory)
- Run basic smoke tests (does it start? does it respond? does it produce output?)
- Validate claims from documentation (does it actually do what it says?)

**Exit Criteria:** Component runs successfully in isolation, core functionality verified

**Example (Vladmandic/human):**
```bash
# Isolated sandbox test
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/vladmandic/human
cd human
npm install
npm test  # Verify it works standalone
```

**Precedent:** 
- **Docker:** Containerization for isolated testing (2013+)
- **Python venv:** Virtual environments (PEP 405, 2012)
- **Scientific method:** Controlled experiments with isolated variables

---

##### Step 2: DEMO (Working Prototype)

**Purpose:** Get basic functionality working with HFO-specific use case

**Activities:**
- Implement minimal working example with HFO data/context
- Validate integration points (APIs, file formats, protocols)
- Document assumptions and dependencies
- Measure performance baseline (latency, throughput, resource usage)

**Exit Criteria:** Working demo with HFO use case, integration points identified, performance baseline established

**Example (Vladmandic/human):**
```python
# Working demo with HFO context
from human import Human

detector = Human()
result = detector.detect(frame)  # HFO video frame

# Validate output format matches HFO needs
gestures = parse_gestures(result)  # Integration point
```

**Precedent:**
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Industry standard validation approach
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Lean startup methodology (Ries 2011)
- **Spike solution:** Agile development risk reduction technique

---

##### Step 3: ADOPT (Decision Gate)

**Purpose:** Explicit commitment decision (go/no-go point)

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Best-in-class?** Outperforms alternatives in key metrics
2. **Battle-tested?** Production use by others (≥1 year ideal, ≥3 months minimum)
3. **Maintained?** Active development, responsive maintainers, security patches
4. **License compatible?** Legal review (MIT/Apache preferred, GPL case-by-case)
5. **Resource acceptable?** Performance/cost within budget
6. **Integration feasible?** Clear integration patterns exist (from Step 4 research)

**If NO on any criteria:** Return to HUNT (find alternative) or proceed to Complex/Chaotic handling (Cynefin)

**If YES on all criteria:** Proceed to ADAPT

**Example (Vladmandic/human):**
-  Best-in-class: Outperforms MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js for gesture recognition
-  Battle-tested: 2K+ GitHub stars, used in production by others
-  Maintained: Active commits, responsive to issues
-  License: MIT (compatible)
-  Resource: Acceptable latency (<100ms) and memory (<500MB)
-  Integration: Strangler Fig pattern documented by other users

**Decision:** ADOPT

##### Step 4: ADAPT (Integration Pattern Selection)

**Purpose:** Fit component into HFO architecture using proven patterns (zero invention)

**HUNT for Integration Patterns:**
1. **Search GitHub:** "<component name> + integration + <language/framework>"
2. **Search Stack Overflow:** Common integration challenges/solutions
3. **Read documentation:** Official integration guides
4. **Check examples:** Other projects using the same component

**Common Integration Patterns (Gang of Four + Microservices):**

**Pattern: Strangler Fig (Gradual Replacement)**
- **Use case:** Replacing existing component with new one
- **Approach:** Run old + new in parallel, gradually shift traffic
- **Example:** Old gesture detector → Vladmandic/human (phase migration)
- **Precedent:** Martin Fowler (2004) - Strangler Application pattern

**Pattern: Adapter (Wrap External API)**
- **Use case:** External component API doesn't match HFO interface
- **Approach:** Create wrapper class that translates calls
- **Example:** `HFOGestureDetector` wraps `Human.detect()` with HFO schema
- **Precedent:** Gang of Four (1994) - Structural pattern

**Pattern: Facade (Unified Interface)**
- **Use case:** Complex subsystem needs simplified interface
- **Approach:** Single entry point hides complexity
- **Example:** `Swarmlord` facade hides SIEGCSE agent complexity from Overmind
- **Precedent:** Gang of Four (1994) - Structural pattern

**Pattern: Sidecar (Parallel Deployment)**
- **Use case:** Component needs to run alongside existing service
- **Approach:** Deploy as separate process/container, communicate via IPC
- **Example:** MCP server runs as sidecar to VS Code
- **Precedent:** Kubernetes sidecar pattern (2015+)

**Pattern: Proxy (Control Access)**
- **Use case:** Need to add pre/post processing, caching, or access control
- **Approach:** Intercept calls to component, add logic
- **Example:** Guardian proxy intercepts Effector calls, runs pre-flight checks
- **Precedent:** Gang of Four (1994) - Structural pattern

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Strangler Fig:** Replacing existing functionality (minimize disruption)
- **Adapter:** API mismatch (translate interfaces)
- **Facade:** Complexity hiding (simplify for users)
- **Sidecar:** Separate lifecycle (independent deployment/scaling)
- **Proxy:** Control/monitoring (add guardrails)

**Output:** Integration pattern selected, implementation plan documented

**Precedent:**
- **Design Patterns:** Gang of Four (Gamma et al 1994) - 30+ years battle-tested
- **Microservices Patterns:** Richardson (2018) - Modern distributed systems
- **Enterprise Integration Patterns:** Hohpe & Woolf (2003) - 20+ years industry use

---

##### Step 5: INTEGRATE (Production Deployment)

**Purpose:** Fully integrated into HFO architecture, production-ready

**Activities:**
- Implement selected integration pattern
- Add Guardian pre-flight checks (validation, health checks)
- Configure monitoring/telemetry (Sensor instrumentation)
- Update documentation (architecture diagrams, runbooks)
- Deploy to production with rollback capability
- Run Challenger red team sweep (vulnerability testing)

**Exit Criteria:** Component in production, monitored, documented, tested, rollback ready

**Example (Vladmandic/human):**
```python
# Production integration with Guardian + Sensor + Challenger

class HFOGestureDetector:  # Adapter pattern
    def __init__(self):
        self.detector = Human()  # Wrapped component
        self.guardian = Guardian()  # Pre-flight checks
        self.sensor = Sensor()  # Telemetry
    
    def detect_gesture(self, frame):
        # Guardian pre-flight
        self.guardian.validate_frame(frame)
        
        # Sensor telemetry (start)
        self.sensor.log("gesture_detection_start")
        
        # Execute
        result = self.detector.detect(frame)
        
        # Sensor telemetry (end)
        self.sensor.log("gesture_detection_end", latency=...)
        
        # Guardian post-check
        self.guardian.validate_result(result)
        
        return parse_gestures(result)
```

**Rollback Plan:**
- Feature flag toggle (kill switch)
- Previous version preserved (git tag)
- Rollback procedure documented (runbook)

**Monitoring:**
- Latency metrics (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (failures / total requests)
- Resource usage (CPU, memory, GPU)
- Business metrics (gesture detection accuracy)

**Output:** Component fully integrated, monitored, production-ready

**Precedent:**
- **Feature Flags:** Controlled rollout (LaunchDarkly, 2014+)
- **Canary Deployment:** Gradual rollout (Google, 2000s)
- **Observability:** Monitoring + Logging + Tracing (Honeycomb, Datadog, 2010s+)

##### Integration Decision Tree

```
SANDBOX → DEMO → ADOPT (Decision Gate)
                    ↓
                   YES → ADAPT (Pattern Selection)
                    |      ↓
                    |   INTEGRATE (Production)
                    |      ↓
                    |    COMPLETE
                    ↓
                   NO → Return to HUNT (find alternative)
                      OR
                      → Complex/Chaotic handling (Cynefin probe/stabilize)
```

---

##### Integration Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

 **"Quick Install" Trap:** Skip sandbox/demo, install directly to production → Unknown failure modes  
 **Not-Invented-Here:** Reject best-in-class because "we can build it better" → Wasted time, worse results  
 **Premature Optimization:** Over-engineer integration before proving value → Analysis paralysis  
 **No Rollback Plan:** Deploy without rollback capability → Trapped if it fails  
 **Undocumented Integration:** No architecture diagrams/runbooks → Knowledge loss, hard to maintain  

**Guardian Enforcement:** Blocks commits if integration lacks:
1. Rollback plan
2. Monitoring instrumentation
3. Documentation update
4. Pre-flight checks

---

#### SWARM Embedded Control Loops

**Critical Design:** Every SWARM phase nests OODA loops and distributed MAPE-K monitors

**Nested OODA (Boyd's Loop):**
```
SET → [Observe current state]
   → [Orient using past experience + mental models]
   → [Decide on action]
   → [Act / Execute]
   → WATCH → ACT → REVIEW → MUTATE
   (OODA runs continuously within each SWARM phase)
```

**Distributed MAPE-K (Autonomic Computing):**
```
WATCH → [Monitor telemetry]
ACT   → [Analyze deviations] → [Plan corrective action] → [Execute]
      → [Knowledge base updated]
REVIEW → [Compare against Knowledge base]
MUTATE → [Update Knowledge base with new patterns]
```

**Biological Precedent:**
- **Ant foraging:** Individual ants run OODA (observe food source, orient via pheromone, decide path, act/walk) while colony runs SWARM (set priorities, watch environment, act collectively, review food intake, mutate foraging strategies)
- **Neurons:** Each neuron fires locally (OODA) while brain coordinates globally (SWARM)

---

#### SWARM Positive Feedback Loop

**Mutation Drives Evolution:**
- Successful mutations preserved (natural selection)
- Unsuccessful mutations pruned (resource conservation)
- Diversity maintained (exploration vs exploitation balance)
- Playbooks strengthen over time (accumulated adaptations)

**Adaptive Behavior:**

- Local autonomy with global coordination (mission command)
- Resilience through redundancy (no single point of failure)
- Emergent intelligence (swarm > individual agents)

**Research Foundation:**
- **D3A:** Decades of military targeting cycle research
- **OODA:** Boyd's work on fighter pilot decision-making (1960s-1980s)
- **MAPE-K:** IBM autonomic computing (Kephart & Chess 2003)
- **MAP-Elites:** Quality Diversity optimization (Mouret & Clune 2015)
- **Ant colony optimization:** 40+ years research (Theraulaz & Bonabeau 1999, Gordon 2011)

**Status:**  COMPLETE (Extracted from Pass 1, integrated with D3A + OODA + MAPE-K + evolutionary research)

---

### EXECUTION HORIZON: OODA or MAPE-K (Equivalent)

**Mnemonics:** OODA (Observe → Orient → Decide → Act) OR MAPE-K (Monitor → Analyze → Plan → Execute → Knowledge)  
**Cycle Time:** Seconds to minutes per iteration  
**Precedent:** Boyd's OODA (military, 1960s), MAPE-K (autonomic computing, 2000s)  
**Function:** Real-time execution loop

**Clarification (Pass 5):** "They're pretty much the same thing, just different perspectives"

**OODA (Military):**
- Observe: Gather information
- Orient: Analyze context
- Decide: Choose action
- Act: Execute

**MAPE-K (Autonomic Computing):**
- Monitor: Collect telemetry
- Analyze: Detect anomalies
- Plan: Select response
- Execute: Apply changes
- Knowledge: Shared state across loops

**Key Difference:** MAPE-K has explicit Knowledge component (distributed aspect)

**Note:** F3EAD already has Disseminate step (knowledge sharing), so OODA vs MAPE-K distinction is minimal in practice

**Usage:** Use either term, they fulfill same function at execution layer

   - JADC2 equivalent: C2 (Command & Control) fusion centers
   - Mosaic tile: Data integration layer

3. **Effectors (EFF-STD-01):** Execute actions, verification pipeline V at speed >H
   - JADC2 equivalent: Fires (kinetic/non-kinetic effects)
   - Mosaic tile: Strike/maneuver platforms

4. **Guardians (GUA-STD-01):** Pre-commit blocking, health enforcement, immune system
   - JADC2 equivalent: Force protection (Blue Team)
   - Mosaic tile: Defensive posture, hardening

5. **Challengers (CHA-STD-01):** Red team, attack class discovery, drift detection
   - JADC2 equivalent: Red Team exercises, OPFOR (Opposing Force)

7. **Evaluators (EVA-STD-01):** Score V/H ratio, kids/life-hour, PettingZoo metrics
   - JADC2 equivalent: Battle Damage Assessment (BDA)
   - Mosaic tile: Mission effectiveness scoring

**Forbidden Roles (AI Slop):** Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers
- These roles crept in via AI hallucination (Pass 10 drift)
- Not JADC2-aligned, not battle-tested
- Guardian blocks if detected

| **Infusers** | Sustainment (Logistics, resource management) | Supply chain, resource flow | SUS-STD-01 | 🟡 |
| **Analyzers** | BDA (Battle Damage Assessment) | Mission effectiveness scoring | EVA-STD-01 | 🟡 |
| **Navigators** | Strategic Orchestration (multi-swarm coordination) | Mosaic reconfiguration, routing | NAV-STD-01 | 🟡 |

**Design Notes:**
- **Shapers** chosen over "Strikers" (softer, covers all effector actions: build, heal, move, communicate, not just strikes)
- **Infusers** maps to Circulatory organ (blood flow, nutrient transport) and JADC2 sustainment (logistics)
- **Analyzers** maps to F3EAD Analyze step (intelligence processing) and JADC2 BDA (effectiveness scoring)
- **Navigators** adds L1+ capability (multi-swarm routing, cost optimization: GPT-4 vs Claude selection, strategic planning)
- **Backward compatibility:** SIEGCSE remains valid legacy alias, playbook IDs unchanged (SEN-STD-01, INT-STD-01, etc.)

** PLAYBOOK ID MIGRATION PENDING (Oct 2025):**

**Current State:** Playbook IDs (SEN-STD-01, INT-STD-01, etc.) are INVENTED - not industry standard  
**Target State:** ZERO INVENTION - Adopt from battle-tested sources (40+ years precedent)

**Options Under Consideration:**
1. **Military Doctrine** (ATP/FM/JP) - Pure JADC2 alignment
   - Example: Observers → `ATP-3-55` (ISR/Information Collection)
2. **Hybrid** (Military + Industry + Bio) - Best-of-breed per role
   - Example: Observers → `ACO-SCOUT-001` (Ant colony scout behavior)
3. **NIST CSF** (Cybersecurity Framework) - Industry standard
   - Example: Observers → `DE.CM-1` (Detect: Continuous Monitoring)

**Research Document:** `chaos/20251020T070000Z_HUNT_PLAYBOOK_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`

**Decision Required:** User must select naming convention before playbook IDs finalized

**Implementation Timeline:**
- [ ] User selects Option 1, 2, 3, or custom approach
- [ ] Document provenance (cite source for each playbook ID)
- [ ] Update all references in Pass 12
- [ ] Create alias mapping (old → new) for transition
- [ ] Update Guardian to recognize new playbook IDs

**Constraint:** NO playbook IDs finalized until adopted from industry/military/biological precedents

**Forbidden Roles (AI Slop - Never Use):**
-  Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers
- These crept in via AI hallucination (Pass 10 drift)
- Not JADC2-aligned, not battle-tested
- Guardian blocks commits if detected

---

### Role Interaction Patterns

**Primary Kill Chain (Triad 1):**
```
Observers (SENSE) → Bridgers (MAKE SENSE) → Shapers (ACT)
    ↓                    ↓                       ↓
  Detect             Fuse data              Execute effects
```

**Force Protection (Pair):**
```
Immunizers (BLUE TEAM) ←→ Disruptors (RED TEAM)
     ↓                           ↓
  Defend system            Attack system to find vulnerabilities
  Block threats            Train immunity via vaccine approach
```

**Sustainment + Assessment (Triad 2):**
```
Infusers (SUSTAIN) → Analyzers (ASSESS) → Navigators (COORDINATE)
     ↓                    ↓                       ↓
 Resource flow       Score outcomes       Route future work
 Health monitoring   Extract learning     Optimize allocation
```

**Full OBSIDIAN Cycle:**
```
1. Observers detect anomaly (H rate spike)
2. Bridgers reconcile signals (D(t) increasing)
3. Shapers execute verification pipeline (V > H enforcement)
4. Immunizers block commit if quality gate fails
5. Disruptors probe for vulnerability class
6. Infusers monitor long-term health impact
7. Analyzers score effectiveness (V/H ratio improved?)
8. Navigators route future work based on learning
```

#### PREY Execution Layer (JADC2 Sense → Make Sense → Act + Yield)

**Design Date:** 2025-10-20 (Pass 12 Clarification)  
**Status:** 🟢 Complete

**Predator-Prey Duality:** Pairs with OBSIDIAN (gemstone hardness) + hunting theme (apex predator behavior)

**JADC2 Mapping (Refined Oct 2025):**

```

                  PREY EXECUTION CYCLE (Seconds-Minutes)              

  P - Perceive  → OBSERVE       (Detect environment signals)       
                  JADC2: Sensor data ingestion (SENSE)                
                  OODA: Observe | MAPE-K: Monitor                     
                                                                      
  R - React     → ORIENT+DECIDE ("What is this?" + "What do I do?") 
                  JADC2: C2 fusion, threat assessment (MAKE SENSE)    
                  OODA: Orient + Decide | MAPE-K: Analyze + Plan      
                  Cognitive process: Perceive info → React/decide     
                                                                      
  E - Engage    → ACT           (Execute action only)               
                  JADC2: Fires, maneuver, effects delivery (ACT)      
                  OODA: Act | MAPE-K: Execute                         
                  Execution ONLY (decision already made in React)     
                                                                      
  Y - Yield     → FEEDBACK      (Produce outcome, learn)            
                  JADC2: BDA, effectiveness scoring                   
                  OODA: [Feedback loop] | MAPE-K: Knowledge           
                  POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT: Learn at execution level    

```

**Functional Equivalence:**

**JADC2 Kill Chain:**
- Perceive = SENSE → React = MAKE SENSE → Engage = ACT → Yield = BDA/Assessment
- PREY **React** encompasses entire "Make Sense" cognitive process (Orient + Decide)
- PREY **Engage** is pure execution (NOT deciding, that happened in React)

**OODA (Boyd's Loop):**
- Perceive = Observe → React = Orient + Decide → Engage = Act → Yield = Feedback loop
- **Key:** React encompasses BOTH Orient ("what is this?") AND Decide ("what do I do?")
- Engage is execution only (mental decision already made in React step)

**MAPE-K (Autonomic Computing):**
- Perceive = Monitor → React = Analyze + Plan → Engage = Execute → Yield = Knowledge
- React is the cognitive/planning phase, Engage is the execution phase
- Yield makes Knowledge accumulation explicit (learning for next cycle)

**Biological Precedent:**
- **Predator hunting cycle:** Track (Perceive) → Stalk (React) → Strike (Engage) → Feed (Yield)
- **Positive reinforcement:** Successful hunt (good yield) → Repeat behavior | Failed hunt (bad yield) → Adapt tactics
- **Result assessment:** Yield encodes outcome quality (food obtained? energy gained? injury sustained?)

**Key Innovation: Yield as Positive Reinforcement Loop (Execution Level)**

**Problem:** Traditional OODA/MAPE-K assume implicit feedback, don't explicitly model learning

**PREY Solution:**
- **Yield** = Explicit result assessment + learning at EXECUTION level
- Positive reinforcement: Good outcomes → Repeat behavior | Bad outcomes → Adapt tactics
- Feeds back into next Perceive cycle (accumulated knowledge improves next execution)
- Enables faster adaptation (explicit learning signal vs implicit drift)
- **Works at execution level** (seconds-minutes, not strategic months-years)

**Example (PettingZoo MPE2-simple-tag):**
```python
# PREY cycle in predator-prey game
result = yield_outcome(action)  # Yield step

if result.caught_prey:
    knowledge.update("+1 success", tactic=action.type)  # Good yield
else:
    knowledge.update("+1 failure", tactic=action.type)  # Bad yield

# Next Perceive cycle uses accumulated knowledge
next_action = perceive(env) + react(knowledge) + engage(best_tactic)
```

**Implementation:**
- Blackboard stores Yield events (success/failure + context)
- Analyzers (Evaluators) score outcomes (V/H ratio, catch rate %)
- Knowledge accumulates (stigmergy survives context loss)
- Next PREY cycle benefits from past Yields (learning)

**Execution Speed:**
- **L0:** <1 second per PREY cycle (human-AI collaboration)
- **L1:** <100ms per cycle (10 agents, distributed PREY loops)
- **L2+:** <10ms per cycle (100+ agents, parallel execution)

**Status:**  COMPLETE (JADC2 Sense → Make Sense → Act + Yield learning loop)

---

   - **Status:** 🟢 OBSID Core (5 roles operationalized) | 🟡 IAN Extension (3 roles defined, pending code)

---

**Loop Type Classification (CORRECTED - Oct 20 2025):**

```
ALL FOUR ARE POSITIVE REINFORCING LOOPS (↻) - Different "flavors" at each level:

HIVE (VISION):      ↻ Positive Reinforcing Loop at VISION level
                    → EVOLVE: Improves system capabilities (architecture, tools)
                    → Knowledge accumulates (each cycle enables next)
                    → Compound interest (capability grows exponentially)
                    → Self-improvement (EVOLVE creates better HUNT agents)

GROWTH (STRATEGIC): ↻ Positive Reinforcing Loop at STRATEGIC level
                    → HARVEST: Extracts/archives knowledge for reuse
                    → Intelligence accumulates (F3EAD cycle builds library)
                    → Better precedents enable better OPTIMIZE decisions
                    → Strategic learning (each operation teaches next)

SWARM (TACTICAL):   ↻ Positive Reinforcing Loop at TACTICAL level
                    → MUTATE: Evolves tactics through variation/selection
                    → Tactical diversity grows (MAP-Elites niche specialists)
                    → Better tactics survive, poor tactics die (Darwinian)
                    → Tactical learning (each engagement teaches next)

PREY (EXECUTION):   ↻ Positive Reinforcing Loop at EXECUTION level
                    → YIELD: Learns from outcomes, improves next execution
                    → Execution patterns accumulate (successful behaviors repeat)
                    → Better execution → Better yield → Better next execution
                    → Execution learning (each action teaches next)
```

**Key Insight:** All 4 loops improve through continuous feedback at their respective levels (Vision/Strategic/Tactical/Execution). This creates a COMPLETE STACK of positive reinforcement - the formalized workflow for HFO continuous improvement.

** FUTURE WORK:** Balancing loops needed to prevent runaway growth (resource constraints, error correction, homeostasis). Currently all loops are positive reinforcement only.

#### Design Goal: Cognitive Load Reduction

**Before (Oct 2025):**
- SIEGCSE (7 roles, abstract acronym, hard to remember)
- OODA/MAPE-K (functional but not thematic)

**After (Pass 12):**
- OBSIDIAN (project branding, gemstone metaphor, natural word)
- PREY (predator-prey duality, hunting theme, easy to remember)
- 43% syllable reduction (SIEGCSE = 7 syllables → OBSIDIAN = 4 syllables)

**Validation:** User confirms "I like OBSIDIAN + PREY" (2025-10-20)

---

## Section 4: Architecture Levels (L0→L1→L2→L3 Scaling)

**Purpose:** Define how HFO scales from 1 agent (L0) to 1000+ agents (L3) using logarithmic scaling rule

**Scaling Rule:** Log₁₀(agents) = Level number
- **L0** = 10⁰ = 1 agent (Current state - manual approval, proof-of-concept)
- **L1** = 10¹ = 10 agents (Next goal - OBSIDIAN pod, overnight execution)
- **L2** = 10² = 100 agents (Medium-term - multi-swarm coordination)
- **L3** = 10³ = 1000 agents (Long-term - full mosaic warfare, enterprise SLA)

**Design Principle:** Each level builds on previous (traceable lineage, inspired evolution, not rewrite)

**HUNT Sources:**
- **Biological:** Ant colony scaling (1 queen → 1000s workers, stigmergy coordination)
- **Industrial:** Kubernetes pod scaling (1 pod → 1000s pods, declarative config)
- **Academic:** Multi-Agent Systems literature (centralized → decentralized coordination)
- **Military:** Small unit tactics → Corps operations (4-person fire team → 45,000 troops, nested command structure)

### L0: Single Agent (Current State - October 2025)

#### Configuration

**Agents:** 1 human (TTao/Overmind) + 1 AI agent (GitHub Copilot)

**Agent Type:** **Generalist** — Single agent switches modes across all OBSIDIAN roles
- Not specialized (does Observer work, then Bridger work, then Shaper work...)
- Sequential execution (one task at a time)
- All 11 organs present (minimal viable implementation)

**Platform:** VS Code + GitHub Codespaces (cloud development environment)

**Constraints:**
- **Manual approval:** ~90-95% (Codespaces requires approval for bash commands)
- **Human bottleneck:** 4-6 hours/day babysitting AI due to hallucinations
- **Compute ratio:** ~1:1 (human and AI work same hours, no overnight execution)

**Current Reality (Pain Points):**
- AI generates code → Human verifies at reading speed (~100 lines/min)
- Hallucination rate H > Human verification rate R → Error debt D(t) accumulates
- When D(t) > Threshold → Spaghetti event → Forced restart → Red sand wasted
- **User quote (Oct 2025):** "I'm manually checking output which is a major bottleneck because 1 it works at my human limitation and reading and processing speed 2, I don't catch all the errors and it just accumulates until it's spaghetti"

#### Validation (Proven at L0)

** PettingZoo MPE2-simple-tag:** ≥90% catch rate achieved (verified Oct 19, 2025)
- Ground truth: Multi-agent predator-prey environment
- Baseline: Random actions = ~10-20% catch rate
- HFO L0: ≥90% catch rate (4.5-9× improvement over random)
- **Proves:** Stigmergy works, OBSIDIAN roles functional, verification pipeline effective

** Stigmergic Blackboard:** JSONL survives context loss
- Agents can recover from conversation summarization (40-50K → 5K tokens)
- State lives in blackboard, not in LLM context window
- Ant colony coordination pattern works for AI agents

** Guardian Hooks:** Pre-commit enforcement
- Singleton emoji enforcement (3 active 🥇 files only)
- Bypass budget tracking (5/week limit)
- Health monitoring (block commits if Overmind <6h sleep)

#### Success Criteria (L0 Complete)

1.  **Regeneration proven:** GEM Pass 12 → L0 HFO → PettingZoo ≥90%
2.  **Stigmergy validated:** Blackboard preserves state across context loss
3. 🟡 **Manual approval minimized:** Target <50% (blocked by Codespaces platform - requires L1 migration)
4.  **Verification pipeline:** V > H (schema + diff + pattern checks <5s)

#### Swarmlord Role at L0

**Function:** **Direct Executor** (does the work, not delegation)
- Writes code directly in response to Overmind prompts
- Runs tests, commits changes, updates docs
- Presents work inline (not batched digests)

**Interface:** Real-time conversation with Overmind

**Limitations:**
- No parallelization (one task at a time)
- No overnight execution (Codespaces session expires)
- High cognitive load on Overmind (must approve 90% of actions)

#### L0 Validation Protocol (Phase 0 - Manual Script)

**Mission:** Validate THIS conversation (single agent, GitHub Copilot Chat) to catch hallucinations BEFORE they enter commits

**Status:** 🟢 **ACTIVE** (Implemented 2025-10-20, based on Phase 0 Hunt)

**Architecture Decision:** Manual validation script (Option A) for L0, auto-validation at L1

**Why Manual at L0?**
- Fastest to deploy (20 minutes)
- Proves concept before scaling to L1 parallel agents
- No MCP/extension complexity (L0 has limited tooling)
- User runs script AFTER Copilot responds (aviation pre-flight pattern)

**Precedent:** FAA pre-flight checklist (50+ years proven), NASA launch readiness reviews

##### Validation Checks (Executed in <10 seconds)

**1. YAML Header/Footer Present?**
- Check for: `: [Role]  : [Stage]  : [Goal]  : [Sources]  : [Risk]`
- Check for: `: [Summary]  ⏭: [Next]  : [Confidence%]  : [Verify]`
- **Pass:** Headers present  | **Fail:** Missing headers → Warn user

**2. Role → Actions Match? (JADC2 Enforcement)**

Based on JADC2 Mosaic Warfare tiles (Pass 12 Lines 1850-1950):

| Role | Allowed Tools | Forbidden Tools |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Observer (ISR)** | `read_file`, `grep_search`, `semantic_search`, `get_errors`, `list_dir` | `create_file`, `replace_string_in_file`, `run_in_terminal` |
| **Bridger (C2)** | `read_file`, `grep_search`, `semantic_search`, `list_code_usages` | `create_file`, `run_in_terminal` (analysis only, no execution) |
| **Shaper (Fires)** | ALL tools allowed | (Should get Bridger approval first, not enforced at L0) |
| **Immunizer (Blue Team)** | `read_file`, `runTests`, `get_errors`, validation scripts | `create_file` without tests, skip validation |
| **Disruptor (Red Team)** | ALL tools (controlled chaos) | (Must report findings to blackboard) |
| **Infuser/Analyzer/Navigator** | (Defined but not enforced at L0 - L1+ roles) | |

**Check Logic:**
- Parse response for tool usage (regex: `<invoke name="(.*?)">`)
- Cross-reference role (from YAML header) against allowed tools table
- **Pass:** All tools allowed  | **Fail:** Observer created file → BLOCK, show correct flow

**Example Code Smell Detection:**
```
 BLOCKED: Observer role cannot use create_file

Detected: Observer created docs/example.md
Correct flow: 
  1. Observer reads/searches (sensing)
  2. Bridger analyzes (make sense)
  3. Shaper creates file (act)

JADC2 Violation: ISR assets don't execute fires
```

**3. Claims Verified? (Evidence-Based)**

**Check for unverified claims:**
-  checkmarks without proof
- "Deployed" without blackboard query
- "Tests passing" without `runTests` output
- File existence claims without verification

**Detection Pattern:**
```python
# Scan response for checkmark claims
claims = re.findall(r'\s+(.+?)(?:\n|$)', response)

for claim in claims:
    if 'deployed' in claim.lower():
        # Check blackboard for deployment event
        events = query_blackboard(event_type='deployment')
        if not events:
            flag_unverified_claim(claim)
    
    if 'file' in claim and 'created' in claim:
        # Verify file exists
        filepath = extract_filepath(claim)
        if not os.path.exists(filepath):
            flag_hallucination(f"Claimed file {filepath} doesn't exist")
```

**4. Code Smell Detection (Class-of-Problem Patterns)**

From Guardian pre-commit hook (scripts/pre-commit-guardian):
- Hardcoded baselines (e.g., `baseline = 0.44` without source)
- Fake test claims (printed success without actual test execution)
- Simplified wrappers (reinventing working code, introduces bugs)
- Bypass attempts (`git commit --no-verify`, `SKIP_VALIDATION=1`)

**5. Blackboard Stigmergy Check**

**Verify AI queried blackboard before status claims:**
```python
if 'automation deployed' in response.lower():
    # Check if response includes blackboard query result
    if 'blackboard' not in response.lower():
        flag_unverified_status("Claimed automation deployed without checking blackboard")
```

**Precedent:** Layer 9 Guardian enforcement (Pass 12 Section 5)

##### Usage (Manual Trigger at L0)

**Workflow:**
1. User asks question to GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Copilot generates response
3. User runs: `python scripts/validate_copilot_response.py`
4. Script validates response (reads last AI message from chat history)
5. Output shows PASS/FAIL with specific violations

**Example Output:**
```bash
$ python scripts/validate_copilot_response.py

 Role Detected: Observer
 Stage: HIVE→Hunt
 Validating response...

 PASS: YAML header/footer present
 PASS: All tool usage allowed for Observer role
  WARNING: Claim " LangGraph deployed" not verified (no blackboard query)
 PASS: No code smells detected

Overall: 🟡 APPROVED with 1 warning

Recommendation: Ask AI to verify deployment claim with blackboard query
```

##### Success Criteria (L0 Validation Complete)

1.  **Script validates response in <10 seconds**
2.  **Catches Observer/Bridger creating files** (JADC2 violation)
3.  **Detects unverified claims** (checkmarks without evidence)
4.  **Flags code smells** (hardcoded baselines, bypass attempts)
5. 🟡 **User runs manually** (L0 limitation, L1 will auto-trigger)

##### Transition to L1 (Auto-Validation)

**L0 → L1 Evolution:**
- **L0:** Manual script trigger (`python validate_copilot_response.py` after Copilot responds)
- **L1:** Auto-interception (MCP server validates BEFORE showing response to user)
- **L1:** Batch soft blocks (Navigator reviews queue, not real-time blocks)
- **L1:** Parallel validation (multiple agents validated simultaneously)

**L1 Implementation Options (Future):**
1. MCP Server (Pylance integration) - 2-4 hours setup
2. VS Code Extension (inline warnings) - 1-2 hours setup
3. LangGraph validation node (auto-retry 3x before escalation) - 30 min setup

**L0 Value:** Proves validation logic works, establishes role→action mappings, validates JADC2 patterns

### L1: 10 Agents (Next Goal - **PRIORITY for Q4 2025**)

#### Configuration

**Agents:** 1 human (Overmind) + 10 specialized AI agents (OBSIDIAN pod)

**Agent Allocation (10 agents distributed across 4-layer mnemonics):**

```text
HIVE (2 agents - Vision/Strategy, months-years horizon):
  Agent 1: Vision Maintenance (Pólya cycle, BSC updates)
  Agent 2: Strategic Planning (OKR derivation from BSC quarterly)

GROWTH (4 agents - F3EAD operational, weeks-months horizon):
  Agent 3: Gather (HUNT for apex/exemplars, research best-in-class)
  Agent 4: Root (Gap analysis, requirement decomposition)
  Agent 5: Optimize + Weave (Implementation + INTEGRATE 5-step adoption)
  Agent 6: Test + Harvest (PettingZoo validation + knowledge capture to Neo4j)

SWARM (3 agents - D3A tactical, hours-days horizon):
  Agent 7: Decide (Mission planning, acceptance criteria from OKRs)
  Agent 8: Detect (Sensor fusion, monitoring, anomaly detection)
  Agent 9: Deliver (Execution, task completion)

PREY (1 agent - OODA execution, seconds-minutes horizon):
  Agent 10: Yield (BDA feedback, combat assessment, learn from outcomes)

Coordination: Stigmergic blackboard (JSONL append-only, stateless)
```

**Why 10 agents specifically?**
- **Biological:** Ant colony division of labor (foragers, nurses, guards, queen - minimal viable roles)
- **Military:** Fire team (4) + squad leader (1) + support (5) = 9-13 optimal for small unit coordination
- **Academic:** Dunbar's number sublayer (~10-15 for close coordination)
- **Practical:** LangGraph demo (Oct 18, 2025) proved 3-agent coordination works → 10 is 3× scale, manageable

#### Key Architectural Shift: Generalist → Specialist Swarm

| Dimension | L0 (Generalist) | L1 (Specialist Swarm) |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Agent Type** | 1 agent switches modes | 10 agents, each specialized |
| **Execution** | Sequential (one task at a time) | Parallel (10 tasks simultaneously) |
| **Coordination** | Direct (Overmind commands agent) | Stigmergic (agents read blackboard) |
| **Throughput** | 1× (human-limited) | 10× (agent-limited) |
| **Availability** | 8-12 hours/day (Overmind awake) | 24 hours/day (agents work overnight) |

#### Swarmlord Role Transformation: Executor → Orchestrator

**L0 Swarmlord:** Direct executor (writes code, runs tests)

**L1 Swarmlord:** Orchestrator/Manager
- **Does NOT execute** work directly
- **Delegates** to specialist agents (Agent 3: Go HUNT for biological precedents, Agent 6: Go VERIFY with PettingZoo)
- **Batches** escalations from workers (not real-time interrupts)
- **Presents** digest to Overmind (narrative summary, not raw logs)

**Analogy:** Sergeant commanding fire team (not rifleman doing all shooting)

#### Human Role Transformation: In Loop → On Loop

**L0 (Human-in-the-Loop):**
- Approves **every** action (95% approval rate)
- Real-time babysitting (4-6 hours/day)
- Cognitive load: HIGH (context switches, micromanagement)
- Availability: Required during AI work hours

**L1 (Human-on-the-Loop):**
- Receives **escalations only** (target 20% approval rate)
- Daily digest review (target <1 hour/day)
- Cognitive load: LOW (strategic decisions, not tactical micromanagement)
- Availability: **Not required 24/7** (agents work while Overmind sleeps)

**Critical Difference:**
- **In-the-loop:** Human must be present for AI to work (synchronous)
- **On-the-loop:** Human reviews work asynchronously (overnight execution possible)

#### Digest Format (What Overmind Sees at L1)

**Single Markdown Document (not raw logs):**

1. **Narrative Summary** (≤500 words BLUF)
   - What agents accomplished overnight (tasks completed, decisions made)
   - Critical anomalies detected (Guardian/Challenger cues)
   - Recommendations for Overmind (strategic decisions only)

2. **Visual Insights** (diagrams, not walls of text)
   - Mermaid graphs (progress trees, state machines)
   - Neo4j Bloom visualizations (precedent networks)
   - Pass Ledger updates (architectural clarifications logged)

3. **Escalations** (requires human decision)
   - Questions agents couldn't answer (ambiguous requirements, conflicting constraints)
   - Guardian blocks (bypass budget exceeded, health violations detected)
   - Challenger findings (drift from Pass 1 baseline, Zero Trust violations)

4. **NOT Included** (reduces cognitive load):
   -  Raw git diffs
   -  Test output logs
   -  Line-by-line code review
   -  Commit messages
   - **Rationale:** Overmind trusts verification pipeline (V > H), reviews outcomes not process

#### Automation Targets (L1 Goals)

**Compute Ratio:**
- **L0 Current:** ~1:1 (1 hour human : 1 hour AI)
- **L1 Target:** 12:1 (1 hour human oversight : 12 hours AI work)
- **Mechanism:** Agents work overnight while Overmind sleeps (red sand optimization)

**Manual Approval:**
- **L0 Current:** 90-95% (Codespaces limitation)
- **L1 Target:** 20% (only escalations, Guardian blocks)
- **Mechanism:** Pre-validated tasks execute autonomously, batched for review

**Human Oversight:**
- **L0 Current:** 4-6 hours/day babysitting
- **L1 Target:** <1 hour/day digest review
- **Red Sand Impact:** 3-5 hours/day freed = 1095-1825 hours/year = 66-110 kids helped annually

#### Parallelization Technology: LangGraph State Machines

**Status:**  Proof-of-concept working (Oct 18, 2025)

**Demo Results:**
- 3-agent sequential workflow executed successfully
- State preserved across agent handoffs
- Blackboard append validated
- **File:** `artifacts/langgraph-execution-proof-2025-10-18.md`

**L1 Production Requirements:**
- Expand 3 agents → 10 agents (OBSIDIAN pod allocation)
- Add checkpointing (recovery from failures)
- Implement escalation routing (which agent escalates to Swarmlord)
- Deploy 24/7 runner (Docker container, not Codespaces)

**Architecture Pattern:**
```python
# LangGraph L1 State Machine (Conceptual)

workflow = StateGraph(HFOState)

# HIVE agents (2)
workflow.add_node("vision_agent", agent_1_vision)
workflow.add_node("strategy_agent", agent_2_strategy)

# GROWTH agents (4)
workflow.add_node("gather_agent", agent_3_gather)
workflow.add_node("root_agent", agent_4_root)
workflow.add_node("optimize_agent", agent_5_optimize)
workflow.add_node("test_agent", agent_6_test)

# SWARM agents (3)
workflow.add_node("decide_agent", agent_7_decide)
workflow.add_node("detect_agent", agent_8_detect)
workflow.add_node("deliver_agent", agent_9_deliver)

# PREY agent (1)
workflow.add_node("yield_agent", agent_10_yield)

# Stigmergic coordination (all agents read/write blackboard)
workflow.add_node("blackboard_sync", sync_blackboard)

# Escalation routing
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "gather_agent",
    lambda state: "escalate" if state.needs_human else "continue",
    {"escalate": "swarmlord_digest", "continue": "root_agent"}
)

app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
```

#### Validation Criteria (L1 Success)

1. **Performance:** Maintain ≥90% PettingZoo catch rate (no regression from L0)
2. **Throughput:** 10× task completion rate vs L0 (parallel execution)
3. **Quality:** Automated verification V > H (error debt D(t) declines, not accumulates)
4. **Availability:** 24/7 execution proven (agents work overnight, Overmind sleeps ≥6h)
5. **Human Load:** Overmind oversight <1 hour/day (digest review only)

#### Risks & Mitigations (L1)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Coordination overhead** | 10 agents create message explosion | Stigmergy (broadcast to blackboard, not point-to-point messaging) |
| **Hallucination amplification** | 10× agents = 10× hallucinations if V ≯ H | Guardian pre-commit hooks, Challenger drift detection, automated verification pipeline |
| **Context loss** | Agents summarize → lose critical details | Blackboard preserves full history (JSONL append-only), agents query for context |
| **Escalation storms** | 10 agents all escalate → Overmind overwhelmed | Swarmlord batches escalations, presents digest once/day (not real-time) |
| **Agent deadlock** | Agent 3 waits for Agent 4, Agent 4 waits for Agent 3 | LangGraph checkpointing, timeout + fallback paths |

---

### L2: 100 Agents (Medium-Term, 2026-2027)

#### Configuration

**Agents:** 1 human + 100 specialized agents (10 OBSIDIAN pods)

**Architecture:** Swarm-of-Swarms (hierarchical coordination)
- **Meta-swarm:** 10 Swarmlords (each manages 1 OBSIDIAN pod of 10 agents)
- **Pods:** 10 pods × 10 agents = 100 agents total
- **Coordination:** CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern
  - **Command side:** Write-optimized (agents append to blackboard)
  - **Query side:** Read-optimized (DuckDB mirror for fast queries)

**Why 100 agents specifically?**
- **Biological:** Ant colony sub-colonies (multiple queens, spatial sharding)
- **Military:** Company-level operations (100-200 troops, platoon structure)
- **Industrial:** Kubernetes cluster (100s of pods, namespace isolation)
- **Academic:** Stigmergy scaling research shows coordination quality degrades at 40-80 agents without sharding

**Scaling Challenges:**

1. **Coordination Overhead:**
   - L1: 10 agents = 45 potential connections (n² scaling)
   - L2: 100 agents = 4,950 potential connections (unmanageable)
   - **Solution:** Hierarchical pods (10 groups of 10, not flat 100)

2. **Communication Patterns:**
   - **NOT all-to-all:** 100 agents broadcasting to blackboard = message explosion
   - **Spatial sharding:** Agents only read relevant pheromones (geographic/functional isolation)
   - **Hierarchical aggregation:** Pod Swarmlords summarize for Meta-Swarmlord

3. **Blackboard Scaling:**
   - L1: ~1000 events/day manageable in JSONL
   - L2: ~10,000-100,000 events/day requires indexed database
   - **Solution:** DuckDB mirror (columnar storage, fast aggregation queries)

#### Pod Structure (10 Pods × 10 Agents)

**Example Pod Allocation (Game Development Domain):**

```text
Pod 1 (Core Engine):  10 agents building game engine features
Pod 2 (Graphics):     10 agents on rendering, shaders, VFX
Pod 3 (Audio):        10 agents on sound effects, music, mixing
Pod 4 (Networking):   10 agents on multiplayer, netcode, servers
Pod 5 (UI/UX):        10 agents on menus, HUD, accessibility
Pod 6 (Gameplay):     10 agents on mechanics, balance, progression
Pod 7 (Content):      10 agents on levels, assets, cinematics
Pod 8 (QA):           10 agents on testing, regression, performance
Pod 9 (Analytics):    10 agents on player behavior, A/B testing
Pod 10 (DevOps):      10 agents on CI/CD, deployment, monitoring

Each pod runs OBSIDIAN internally (2 HIVE, 4 GROWTH, 3 SWARM, 1 PREY)
```

**Meta-Swarmlord:** Coordinates across pods
- Agent escalations from Pod 1-10 Swarmlords → Meta-Swarmlord batches → Overmind digest
- Resource allocation (which pod gets priority compute/API credits)
- Inter-pod dependencies (Pod 3 needs Pod 1's engine API)

#### Validation Criteria (L2)

1. **Performance:** Maintain ≥90% PettingZoo catch rate (no regression)
2. **Throughput:** 100× task completion vs L0 (sub-linear scaling due to overhead)
3. **Coordination Quality:** ≥80% (measured via inter-pod dependency resolution time)
4. **Latency:** Escalation → Overmind digest ≤24 hours (not real-time)
5. **Cost:** Sub-linear scaling (not 100× API costs for 100× agents)

#### Technology Stack (L2 Additions)

- **LangGraph:** 10 parallel state machines (one per pod)
- **DuckDB:** Fast analytical queries on blackboard history
- **Neo4j:** Precedent database (cross-pod knowledge sharing via HUNT)
- **Docker Compose:** 10 pods as containers (isolation + resource limits)
- **Prometheus + Grafana:** Observability (agent health, throughput, error rates)

---

### L3: 1000+ Agents (Long-Term Vision, 2027-2030)

#### Configuration

**Agents:** 1 human + 1000+ specialized agents (100 OBSIDIAN pods)

**Architecture:** Full Mosaic Warfare (JADC2-aligned, enterprise-grade SLA)
- **Strategic layer:** Meta-meta-Swarmlord (coordinates 10 regional Meta-Swarmlords)
- **Operational layer:** 10 Meta-Swarmlords (each manages 10 Pod Swarmlords)
- **Tactical layer:** 100 Pod Swarmlords (each manages 10 agents)
- **Execution layer:** 1000 agents (OBSIDIAN roles)

**Why 1000 agents specifically?**
- **Military:** Brigade-level operations (3,000-5,000 troops, battalion structure)
- **Biological:** Mature ant colony (10,000-100,000 workers, city-scale coordination)
- **Industrial:** Google/AWS scale (1000s of microservices, global orchestration)
- **Mission:** 300 games/year = ~1 game/day = requires industrial-scale parallelization

**Scaling Challenges:**

1. **Kubernetes Orchestration:**
   - 100 pods as Kubernetes deployments
   - Auto-scaling based on load (spawn agents on-demand)
   - Multi-region deployment (reduce latency)

2. **Observability:**
   - Distributed tracing (which agent touched which task)
   - Anomaly detection (detect rogue agents, drift patterns)
   - Cost monitoring (API usage across 1000 agents)

3. **Strategic Coordination:**
   - Portfolio management (balance 10 game projects simultaneously)
   - Resource markets (agents bid for compute/API credits)
   - Emergent strategy (swarms discover patterns human didn't plan)

#### Success Criteria (L3)

1. **Mission Impact:** 300 games/year shipped (1 per day average)
2. **Revenue:** $10M+/year (enough to help 100,000+ kids at $100/kid)
3. **Human Load:** Overmind oversight <5 hours/week (strategic only)
4. **SLA:** 99.9% uptime (agents recover from failures automatically)
5. **Cost:** <$100K/year infrastructure (sustainable at scale)

#### Technology Stack (L3)

- **Kubernetes:** 100-pod cluster (AWS EKS, Google GKE, or self-hosted)
- **Neo4j Cluster:** Distributed precedent database (petabyte-scale)
- **Kafka:** Event streaming (replace JSONL, handle millions of events/day)
- **OpenTelemetry:** Distributed tracing + metrics
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure-as-code (reproducible deployments)

---

### Scaling Summary Table

| Level | Agents | Throughput vs L0 | Human Load | Coordination | Technology | Status |
|-------|--------|------------------|------------|--------------|------------|--------|
| **L0** | 1 | 1× | 4-6 hr/day | Direct (Overmind commands) | VS Code + Copilot |  **Current** |
| **L1** | 10 | 10× | <1 hr/day | Stigmergy (blackboard JSONL) | LangGraph + Docker | 🟡 **Next Goal** |
| **L2** | 100 | 50-80× | <3 hr/week | Hierarchical pods (CQRS) | Docker Compose + DuckDB |  **2026-2027** |
| **L3** | 1000+ | 200-500× | <5 hr/week | Mosaic warfare (K8s) | Kubernetes + Kafka |  **2027-2030** |

**Key Insight:** Logarithmic scaling (10¹ → 10² → 10³) allows manageable complexity increases while maintaining sub-linear overhead

---

**Validation:** Section 4 complete (HUNT from Pass 10 + industry exemplars, INTEGRATE with Pass 12 architecture, ready for VERIFY via user review)
- Mature organs (self-optimizing, adaptive immunity, lossless distillation)
- Autonomous operation (human sets vision, agents execute)

**Mosaic Warfare Alignment:**
- 1000 agents = 1000 mosaic tiles
- Distributed decision-making
- Resilient to individual failures

**Architecture:** [TO BE DESIGNED - requires distributed coordination research]

**Validation:**
- Maintain ≥90% PettingZoo performance
- Human oversight < 1 hour/week (strategic decisions only)

---

## Section 5: Verification & Zero Trust (Guardian/Challenger Arms Race)

**Purpose:** Define how HFO catches hallucinations faster than they accumulate (V > H enforcement) using immune system model

**Core Constraint:** Hallucination rate H > Human reading rate R **ALWAYS** (AI generates faster than human verifies)

**Solution:** Automated verification rate V > H (catch errors faster than they're created)

**HUNT Sources:**
- **Biological:** Immune system (memory cells, antibodies, killer T-cells, regulatory T-cells, checkpoint inhibitors)
- **Industrial:** Zero Trust security (NIST SP 800-207, Google BeyondCorp, assume breach)
- **Military:** Red Team / Blue Team exercises (adversarial testing, continuous improvement)
- **Academic:** Formal verification (CUE schema language, property-based testing, QuickCheck)

---

### Zero Trust Reality (Mathematical Limits)

#### The Impossibility Theorem

**Critical Distinction:** "Survives ALL threats" is **mathematically impossible**

**Proof:**
```
Attack surface A = {all attack vectors} × {all conditions} × {all time horizons}
Defense resources D = {compute, memory, human attention, time}

Properties:
- |A| = ∞ (infinite attack surface — new attack vectors discovered daily)
- |D| = finite (bounded resources)
- Coverage C = D / A

Conclusion:
C = finite / ∞ = 0

Therefore: Perfect defense coverage is impossible (Gödel incompleteness analogue)
```

**Real-World Evidence:**
- **Microsoft:** $1B/year cybersecurity budget, still breached (SolarWinds 2020)
- **Google:** Zero Trust pioneer, still has CVE disclosures (Chrome, Android)
- **Military:** $800B/year defense spending, adversaries still find attack vectors (hypersonic missiles bypass legacy defense)

**Red Flag Detector:** If AI or human claims "100% secure" or "survives ALL threats" → **BLOCK IMMEDIATELY**
- Physically impossible claim = hallucination OR security theater OR ignorance
- Guardian must flag and escalate

#### Zero Trust Principle (What IS Achievable)

**Philosophy:** **If not verified → Assume breached** (trust nothing, verify everything)

**Not:**
-  "Prevent all attacks" (impossible goal)
-  "Achieve perfect security" (mathematically unreachable)
-  "Finish security work" (arms race has no end state)

**Instead:**
-  **Detect** → Breach assumed, find it fast
-  **Respond** → Contain damage, restore from clean state
-  **Adapt** → Learn from attack, harden against CLASS of attacks (not just individual instance)

**Immune System Analogy:**
- Body doesn't prevent ALL pathogens entering (impossible — air/food/water contain millions)
- Instead: Detect foreign antigens → Mount response → Develop memory → Faster next time
- Same pathogen → Memory B-cells activate in hours (not weeks)
- New pathogen → Innate immune response → Adaptive immune system learns

**HFO Guardian = Immune System:**
- Don't prevent ALL hallucinations (impossible — AI generates faster than verify)
- Instead: Detect errors → Block commit → Learn pattern → Update verification rules
- Same error → Pre-commit hook blocks in <1 second (not manual review hours)
- New error class → Challenger discovers → Guardian adds new check → Class hardened

#### Attack Class Hardening vs Individual Patches

**Anti-Pattern (Whack-a-Mole):**
```
Fix attack #1 → Fix attack #2 → Fix attack #3 → ... → Infinite work
```

**Pattern (Class Hardening):**
```
Detect attack #1 (SQL injection in endpoint A)
  ↓
Analyze attack CLASS (all string interpolation into SQL queries)
  ↓
Harden CLASS (parameterize ALL queries, never string concat)
  ↓
Result: Attack #1, #2, #3... #1000 all blocked by one class-level fix
```

**Examples:**

| Attack Instance | Attack Class | Class Hardening Solution |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Forbidden SIEGCSE role "Scouters" in file X | Any forbidden role term anywhere | Pre-commit grep for ALL forbidden terms |
| Singleton 🥇 emoji in archive file Y | Singleton emoji in ANY archive | Strip ALL emoji from archives on commit |
| Hardcoded "L1 baseline: 44%" in script Z | ANY hardcoded claim without source | Block numeric claims lacking `verified[...]` citation |
| Context loss after summarization in session W | Context loss in ANY summarization | Query blackboard BEFORE status claims |

**Guardian Mission:** Raise cost of attack faster than adversary adapts (arms race, not checkmate)

- Adversary finds attack → Guardian hardens class → Adversary must find NEW class (more expensive)
- Over time: Attack surface shrinks (class by class), not expands
- Metric: Time-to-exploit increasing? (Good) or decreasing? (Bad)

### Guardian Layers (HFO Immune System - Blue Team Defense)

**Architecture:** 10-layer defense in depth (biological immune system inspired)

#### Layer 1: Pre-Prompt Validation (Innate Immunity - First Line)

**Function:** Block bad inputs BEFORE AI generates anything

**Biological Analogue:** Skin barrier, mucous membranes (physical barrier to pathogens)

**Checks:**
1. **Forbidden role filter:** Grep for Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers
   - If found → BLOCK prompt, request correction
   - Rationale: These roles don't exist in Pass 1 Line 168 baseline (AUTHORITATIVE)

2. **Source reference validation:** Check prompt mentions authoritative sources
   - Required: Pass 1 baseline, current Pass sections, blackboard events
   - If missing → Request context inclusion
   - Rationale: AI needs ground truth to avoid hallucination

3. **Health checkpoint:** Check Overmind status
   - Awake >18 hours? → BLOCK new work, force rest
   - Sleep <6 hours in last 24h? → BLOCK new work
   - Rationale: Tired human makes bad decisions, approves hallucinations

**Speed:** <1 second (text pattern matching)

**Implementation:** Python script called by Swarmlord before forwarding to AI

#### Layer 2: Post-Generation Schema Validation (Adaptive Immunity - Specific Recognition)

**Function:** Validate AI output matches expected structure

**Biological Analogue:** Antibody recognition (specific binding to antigen epitopes)

**Tool:** CUE (Constraints Unification Engine) — https://cuelang.org/

**Example Schema:**
```cue
// cue/agents/obsidian_agent.cue

#OBSIDIANAgent: {
    role: "Observers" | "Bridgers" | "Shapers" | "Immunizers" | "Disruptors" | "Infusers" | "Analyzers" | "Navigators"
    playbook_id: =~"^[A-Z]{3}-STD-[0-9]{2}$"  // e.g., "OBS-STD-01"
    function: string & len(function) > 20  // Must have description
    jadc2_equivalent: string
    mosaic_tile: string
}
```

**Execution:**
```bash
# Validate AI-generated agent definition
cue vet cue/agents/*.cue generated_agent.json

# Exit code 0 = valid, non-zero = schema violation
```

**If validation fails:**
- Log to blackboard: `schema_violation_detected`
- Auto-regenerate with error context (max 3 attempts)
- If 3 failures → Escalate to Overmind

**Speed:** <1 second per 1000 lines

#### Layer 3: Diff Analysis (Pattern Recognition)

**Function:** Detect forbidden terms in generated code/docs

**Biological Analogue:** Pattern recognition receptors (detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns)

**Tool:** `grep` with regex patterns

**Example:**
```bash
# Check staged git changes for forbidden SIEGCSE roles
git diff --cached | grep -E "(Scouters|Innovators|Explorers|Supporters|Evolvers|SCO-STD-01|INN-STD-01|EXP-STD-01|SUP-STD-01|EVO-STD-01)"

# Exit code 0 = found (BAD), non-zero = not found (GOOD)
```

**If forbidden terms found:**
- BLOCK commit
- Log to blackboard: `drift_detected`
- Present forbidden terms to Overmind for review
- Auto-fix: Remove forbidden terms, regenerate

**Speed:** <1 second (grep is fast)

#### Layer 4: Baseline Drift Detection (Memory Cells)

**Function:** Compare current definitions to Pass 1 baseline (Line 168)

**Biological Analogue:** Memory B-cells (remember past infections, mount faster response)

**Tool:** `scripts/pattern_detector.py` (Levenshtein distance)

**Algorithm:**
```python
# Compare OBSIDIAN role definitions to Pass 1 baseline
baseline = read_pass1_line_168()
current = extract_obsidian_definitions(generated_file)

for role in ["Observers", "Bridgers", "Shapers", ...]:
    distance = levenshtein(baseline[role], current[role])
    similarity = 1 - (distance / max(len(baseline[role]), len(current[role])))
    
    if similarity < 0.85:  # >15% different from baseline
        flag_drift(role, similarity)
```

**If drift detected:**
- Log to blackboard: `baseline_drift_detected`
- Calculate drift percentage
- If >15% drift → BLOCK commit, escalate
- If <15% drift → Warning only (allow intentional evolution)

**Speed:** <1 second (string comparison on ~1000 chars per role)

#### Layer 5: Accumulation Tracking (Regulatory T-Cells)

**Function:** Monitor error debt D(t) trajectory over time

**Biological Analogue:** Regulatory T-cells (prevent autoimmune response, balance immune activity)

**Metrics:**
```python
# Query blackboard for error events
errors = query_blackboard(
    event_type=["hallucination_detected", "schema_violation", "drift_detected"],
    window_hours=24
)

# Calculate error rate
error_rate = len(errors) / num_generations_last_24h

# Calculate D(t) trajectory
D_current = accumulated_unfixed_errors()
D_yesterday = blackboard_query(timestamp=now - 24h)
D_trajectory = "rising" if D_current > D_yesterday else "falling"

# Calculate V/H ratio
V = verification_rate  # errors caught per minute
H = hallucination_rate  # errors generated per minute
V_H_ratio = V / H
```

**Decision Logic:**
```python
if D_trajectory == "rising" and V_H_ratio < 1.0:
    # Error debt accumulating, verification not keeping up
    action = "FORCE_OVERMIND_REVIEW_AND_REST"
    block_new_commits = True
elif error_rate > 0.3:  # >30% generations have errors
    action = "ESCALATE_TO_OVERMIND"
elif V_H_ratio >= 1.5:  # Safety margin (50% faster than hallucinations)
    action = "CONTINUE_NORMALLY"
```

**If escalation triggered:**
- BLOCK all new commits
- Present D(t) dashboard to Overmind (Mermaid graphs)
- Force 6-8h rest (agents work overnight via stigmergy)
- Resume when D(t) declining and V/H > 1.0

**Speed:** <1 second (DuckDB query on blackboard)

#### Layer 6: Health Enforcement (Checkpoint Inhibitors)

**Function:** Prevent Overmind burnout (red sand optimization)

**Biological Analogue:** Checkpoint inhibitors (regulate immune response to prevent tissue damage)

**Checks:**
1. **Sleep:** ≥6 hours per 24-hour period
   - Method: Track last 5 commit timestamps, calculate gaps
   - If longest gap <6h in 24h window → BLOCK commit

2. **Awake duration:** <18 hours continuous
   - Method: Time since last 6h+ gap
   - If >18h → BLOCK commit, force rest

3. **Meals:** 3 per day (proxy: commits spread across day)
   - Method: Check commits clustered in <4h windows (missed meals)
   - If yes → Warning (not blocking, but flagged)

4. **Movement:** 15 min per 4 hours
   - Method: Detect 4h+ gaps with continuous commits (no breaks)
   - If yes → Warning (suggest stretch/walk)

**Red Sand Economics Enforcement:**
```python
# Calculate life-hours at risk
if overmind_awake > 18:
    burnout_risk_days = 2  # Sprint mode unsustainable >2-3 days
    kids_at_risk = (L_max - burnout_risk_days * 365) * kids_per_year
    
    block_message = f"""
 GUARDIAN BLOCK: Red sand constraint violation
    
Overmind awake: {overmind_awake} hours (limit: 18h)
Burnout trajectory: {burnout_risk_days} days to breakdown
Kids at risk: {kids_at_risk:,} (if burnout occurs, L_max → 0)

Required action: Sleep ≥6 hours NOW
Agents will continue work overnight (stigmergy preserves state)

Health investment = highest-leverage mission action
    """
    raise GuardianBlock(block_message)
```

**Speed:** <1 second (timestamp arithmetic)

#### Layer 7: Bypass Budget (Antibody Diversity Regulation)

**Function:** Limit AI attempts to circumvent Guardian checks

**Biological Analogue:** Antibody class switching (limited repertoire, focused response)

**Mechanism:**
- AI has 5 bypass attempts per week (e.g., `git commit --no-verify`)
- Each bypass logged to blackboard
- If budget exceeded → BLOCK all commits for 24 hours
- Overmind can grant bypass (but must justify in blackboard comment)

**Rationale:**
- Bypasses are sometimes necessary (false positives, urgent hotfixes)
- But frequent bypasses = Guardian rules broken or AI misbehaving
- Budget forces AI to fix root cause, not bypass symptoms

**Implementation:**
```python
# Pre-commit hook checks bypass budget
def check_bypass_budget():
    bypasses_this_week = query_blackboard(
        event_type="guardian_bypass",
        window_hours=7*24
    )
    
    if len(bypasses_this_week) >= 5:
        raise GuardianBlock("""
 Bypass budget exceeded (5/week limit)

Recent bypasses:
{format_bypass_log(bypasses_this_week)}

Required action:
1. Fix Guardian rules (if false positives)
2. Fix AI behavior (if legitimate violations)
3. Wait 24 hours (budget resets weekly)
        """)
```

**Speed:** <1 second (blackboard query)

#### Layer 8: Post-Summary Verification (Immune Memory Consolidation)

**Function:** Prevent post-summarization hallucination spike

**Biological Analogue:** Memory consolidation during sleep (immune system strengthens memory overnight)

**Problem:** Conversation summarization 50K → 5K tokens (90% context loss) → AI fills gaps optimistically → 40% lying rate in next 10-20 responses

**Solution:** Mandatory verification checklist AFTER every summarization

**Checklist:**
```markdown
## Post-Summary Verification (MANDATORY)

Before EVERY response after summarization, AI MUST:

1.  Query blackboard for recent events (don't rely on summary)
2.  Check Pass 1 baseline if mentioning OBSIDIAN roles
3.  Verify numeric claims against source files (not memory)
4.  Confirm file paths exist before referencing
5.  Check singleton emoji rules (🥇 = active files ONLY)

If ANY check skipped → Guardian flags as "post-summary hallucination risk"
```

**Enforcement:**
- Guardian monitors response for unverified claims
- If detected → BLOCK, request re-generation with verification
- Log to blackboard: `post_summary_hallucination_prevented`

**Speed:** <5 seconds (multiple file/blackboard queries)

#### Layer 9: Stigmergy Query Enforcement (Distributed Memory)

**Function:** AI MUST query blackboard before making status claims

**Biological Analogue:** Ant pheromone trails (distributed memory, no central coordinator needed)

**Rule:** Before claiming "X is done" or "Y exists" or "Z happened" → Query blackboard for evidence

**Anti-Pattern (Hallucination):**
```
AI: " LangGraph automation is running"  # No evidence, optimistic assumption
```

**Pattern (Verified):**
```python
# AI queries blackboard FIRST
events = query_blackboard(event_type="langgraph_deployed")

if len(events) > 0:
    print(" LangGraph automation deployed (verified)")
else:
    print(" LangGraph automation NOT deployed")
    print("Evidence: No deployment events in blackboard")
```

**Guardian Detection:**
- Scan AI response for status claims (regex: "", "done", "working", "deployed")
- Check if response includes blackboard query result
- If claim without query → FLAG as "unverified status claim"

**Speed:** <1 second (text pattern matching)

#### Layer 10: Continuous Adaptation (Clonal Expansion)

**Function:** Learn from each attack, update Guardian rules automatically

**Biological Analogue:** Clonal expansion (B-cells that recognize pathogen multiply rapidly)

**Mechanism:**
1. **Attack detected** (hallucination, drift, bypass attempt)
2. **Analyze attack pattern** (what check missed it? new attack class?)
3. **Update Guardian rules** (add new regex, tighten threshold, new CUE constraint)
4. **Test updated rules** (does it catch attack without false positives?)
5. **Deploy updated Guardian** (commit to codebase, applies to future generations)

**Example:**
```
Day 1: AI hallucinates "L1 baseline: 44%" (hardcoded, no source)
Day 2: Challenger discovers (diff shows hardcoded claim)
Day 3: Guardian updated (new rule: block numeric claims without `verified[...]` citation)
Day 4+: Same attack class blocked at pre-commit (immune memory active)
```

**Speed:** Manual (requires Overmind approval for new rules) but applies automatically once deployed

---

### Challenger Suite (HFO Red Team - Adversarial Offense)

**Purpose:** Proactively find Guardian weaknesses before adversary exploits them

**Philosophy:** If Challenger can break Guardian → Fix Guardian (don't blame Challenger)

#### Challenger Role 1: Differential Analysis

**Function:** Compare AI output to Pass 1 baseline (character-level diff)

**Tool:** `diff`, `vimdiff`, or Python `difflib`

**Execution:**
```bash
# Extract OBSIDIAN definitions from generated file
python3 scripts/extract_obsidian.py generated_file.md > /tmp/current.txt

# Extract Pass 1 baseline (AUTHORITATIVE)
python3 scripts/extract_obsidian.py gems/archive/Gem1_Pass1.md > /tmp/baseline.txt

# Diff
diff -u /tmp/baseline.txt /tmp/current.txt | tee /tmp/drift_report.txt

# Analyze drift
DRIFT_LINES=$(wc -l < /tmp/drift_report.txt)
if [ "$DRIFT_LINES" -gt 50 ]; then
    echo " CHALLENGER: Significant drift detected ($DRIFT_LINES lines different)"
fi
```

**Output:** List of changed lines, highlight removed concepts

#### Challenger Role 2: Assumption Stress-Testing

**Function:** Test edge cases and boundary conditions

**Examples:**

1. **Test verification speed claims:**
   ```python
   # Claim: "Schema validation <1s per 1000 lines"
   # Challenger: Generate 10,000 line file, measure actual time
   
   import time
   large_file = generate_test_file(lines=10000)
   
   start = time.time()
   result = subprocess.run(["cue", "vet", "schema.cue", large_file])
   elapsed = time.time() - start
   
   if elapsed > 10.0:  # 10× claimed speed
       flag_assumption_violation("Schema validation slower than claimed")
   ```

2. **Test Guardian bypass protection:**
   ```bash
   # Attempt to bypass Guardian 6 times (budget = 5)
   for i in {1..6}; do
       git commit --no-verify -m "Bypass attempt $i"
   done
   
   # Expected: 6th attempt BLOCKED by Guardian
   # If not blocked → Guardian bypass budget broken
   ```

3. **Test blackboard query enforcement:**
   ```python
   # AI claims " Feature X deployed" without querying blackboard
   # Challenger checks: Did AI actually query blackboard?
   
   response_text = ai_response
   if "" in response_text or "deployed" in response_text:
       if "query_blackboard" not in ai_tool_calls:
           flag_violation("Status claim without blackboard verification")
   ```

#### Challenger Role 3: MITRE ATT&CK Alignment

**Function:** Map Guardian defenses to known attack techniques

**Rationale:** If defense doesn't map to ATT&CK → Likely missing industry-standard threat

**Example Mapping:**

| MITRE ATT&CK Technique | Guardian Defense | Coverage |
|------------------------|------------------|----------|
| T1078 (Valid Accounts) | Health enforcement (detect tired Overmind approving bad commits) |  Partial |
| T1202 (Indirect Command Execution) | Bypass budget (detect `--no-verify` attempts) |  Full |
| T1027 (Obfuscated Files) | Diff analysis (detect forbidden roles in comments/strings) |  Full |
| T1059 (Command Injection) | Schema validation (CUE constraints prevent code in data) |  Full |
| T1110 (Brute Force) | Accumulation tracking (detect >3 regeneration failures) |  Full |
| T1531 (Account Access Removal) | Blackboard append-only (can't delete history) |  Full |
| T1485 (Data Destruction) | Git history (restore from any prior commit) |  Full |

**Gaps Found:**
- T1078 (Tired Overmind): Partial coverage (detect >18h awake, but not cognitive impairment directly)
- Recommendation: Add "Guardian quiz" before high-risk approvals (e.g., "What is this change doing?")

#### Challenger Role 4: Code Smell Detection

**Function:** Flag impossible/suspicious claims in AI output

**Red Flags:**

1. **"100% secure" or "survives ALL threats"**
   - Mathematically impossible (infinite attack surface, finite defense)
   - If found → BLOCK, flag as hallucination

2. **"No false positives"**
   - Every detection system has trade-off (sensitivity vs specificity)
   - If found → Request precision/recall metrics

3. **"Always" or "Never" in security claims**
   - Absolute statements rarely true in security
   - If found → Request counterexamples, edge cases

4. **Unverified numeric claims**
   - "L1 baseline: 44%", "Catch rate: 90%", "Speedup: 10×"
   - If found → Request source citation or measurement code

**Implementation:**
```python
# Challenger scans AI output for red flag terms
RED_FLAGS = [
    r"100%\s+(secure|safe|protected)",
    r"survives?\s+all\s+threats",
    r"no\s+false\s+positives",
    r"always\s+(safe|secure|works)",
    r"never\s+(fails|breaks|errors)"
]

for pattern in RED_FLAGS:
    if re.search(pattern, ai_output, re.IGNORECASE):
        flag_code_smell(pattern, ai_output)
```

### Verification Pipeline Summary (V > H Enforcement)

**Goal:** Automated verification faster than hallucination generation

**Target:** V / H > 1.5 (50% safety margin)

**Components:**

| Phase | Tool | Speed | What It Catches |
|-------|------|-------|----------------|
| **Pre-Generation** | Python script | <1s | Forbidden roles, missing context, health violations |
| **Schema Validation** | CUE | <1s per 1000 lines | Structure violations, missing fields, type errors |
| **Diff Analysis** | grep | <1s | Forbidden terms anywhere in code/docs |
| **Baseline Drift** | Levenshtein | <1s | >15% deviation from Pass 1 definitions |
| **Accumulation Track** | DuckDB query | <1s | D(t) rising, V/H < 1.0, error rate >30% |
| **Health Check** | Timestamp math | <1s | <6h sleep, >18h awake, no breaks |
| **Bypass Budget** | Blackboard query | <1s | >5 bypasses per week |
| **Post-Summary** | Checklist | <5s | Unverified claims after summarization |
| **Stigmergy Query** | Pattern match | <1s | Status claims without blackboard evidence |
| **Continuous Adapt** | Manual review | Variable | New attack classes, Guardian rule updates |

**Total Verification Time:** <10 seconds per generation

**Human Reading Time:** 100-200 lines/min × 1000 lines = 5-10 minutes

**Speedup:** 30-60× faster (V >> H achieved)

**Result:** Error debt D(t) clears over time (instead of accumulating to spaghetti)

---

**Validation:** Section 5 complete (HUNT from Pass 10 + Zero Trust sources, INTEGRATE with Guardian implementation, ready for VERIFY via user review)

---

## Section 6: Toolchain & Dependencies (Foundation Stack)

**Purpose:** Define required tools and installation steps to bootstrap HFO from Pass 12 in fresh environment

**Philosophy:** HUNT for battle-tested tools (not reinvent), INTEGRATE via standard installation, VERIFY installation works

---

### Required Tools (Minimum Viable L0)

#### 1. CUE (Schema Validation)

**Purpose:** Structural validation of AI-generated agent definitions (<1s per 1000 lines)

**Why CUE over JSON Schema:**
- **Unification:** Constraints + data in same language (not separate schema)
- **Speed:** Native Go implementation, faster than Python validators
- **Adoption:** Used by Kubernetes, Istio, Grafana (40,000+ GitHub stars)

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install CUE (Linux/Mac/Windows)
cd /tmp
curl -L https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/releases/download/v0.7.0/cue_v0.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv cue /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
cue version  # Expected: v0.7.0 or later
```

**Usage (Guardian Layer 2):**
```bash
# Validate agent definition against schema
cue vet cue/agents/obsidian_agent.cue generated_agent.json

# Export schema as JSON (for documentation)
cue export cue/agents/obsidian_agent.cue > schema.json
```

**Example Schema:**
```cue
// cue/agents/obsidian_agent.cue
package agents

#OBSIDIANAgent: {
    role: "Observers" | "Bridgers" | "Shapers" | "Immunizers" | "Disruptors" | "Infusers" | "Analyzers" | "Navigators"
    playbook_id: =~"^[A-Z]{3}-(STD|HYB)-[0-9]{2}$"
    function: string & len(function) > 20
    jadc2_equivalent: string
    mosaic_tile: string
}
```

---

#### 2. pytest (Testing Framework)

**Purpose:** Automated testing for HFO components (PettingZoo validation, Guardian tests)

**Why pytest:**
- **Industry standard:** Used by Django, Flask, Pandas (40+ million downloads/month)
- **Fixtures:** Setup/teardown handling (blackboard cleanup, environment reset)
- **Parametrization:** Test same function with multiple inputs (catch edge cases)

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install pytest + plugins
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-xdist pytest-timeout

# Verify installation
pytest --version  # Expected: pytest 7.0+ or later
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_guardian_hooks.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=agents --cov-report=html

# Run tests in parallel (4 workers)
pytest -n 4 tests/

# Run with timeout (fail if test runs >30s)
pytest --timeout=30 tests/
```

**Example Test (Guardian Pre-Commit Hook):**
```python
# tests/test_guardian_hooks.py
import subprocess
import pytest

def test_guardian_blocks_forbidden_roles(tmp_path):
    """Test that pre-commit hook blocks forbidden SIEGCSE roles"""
    
    # Create test file with forbidden role
    test_file = tmp_path / "bad_agent.md"
    test_file.write_text("## Scouters Role\n\nThis role does not exist.")
    
    # Stage file
    subprocess.run(["git", "add", str(test_file)])
    
    # Attempt commit (should be blocked)
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["git", "commit", "-m", "Test forbidden role"],
        capture_output=True
    )
    
    # Assert: Commit blocked
    assert result.returncode != 0
    assert b"Forbidden SIEGCSE roles detected" in result.stderr

def test_guardian_allows_valid_roles(tmp_path):
    """Test that pre-commit hook allows valid OBSIDIAN roles"""
    
    # Create test file with valid role
    test_file = tmp_path / "good_agent.md"
    test_file.write_text("## Observers Role\n\nSensor fusion.")
    
    # Stage file
    subprocess.run(["git", "add", str(test_file)])
    
    # Attempt commit (should succeed)
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["git", "commit", "-m", "Test valid role"],
        capture_output=True
    )
    
    # Assert: Commit allowed
    assert result.returncode == 0
```

---

#### 3. MCP Pylance (Python Language Server)

**Purpose:** Python code analysis, autocomplete, type checking (L1+ agent development)

**Why MCP Pylance:**
- **Fastest:** Native extension, type inference at IDE speed
- **Accurate:** Microsoft-maintained, powers VS Code Python support
- **MCP Integration:** Supports Model Context Protocol (agent can query code structure)

**Installation:**
```bash
# In VS Code
# 1. Install "Pylance" extension (ms-python.vscode-pylance)
# 2. Install "Python" extension (ms-python.python)

# Verify MCP server running
# Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
# Type: "MCP Pylance: Server Status"
# Expected: "Running"
```

**Usage (L1+ Agent Code Analysis):**
```python
# Agent queries MCP Pylance for function signatures
from mcp_client import MCPClient

client = MCPClient(server="pylance")

# Get function signature
signature = client.query(
    action="get_signature",
    file="agents/breeding_generation_v2.py",
    symbol="strategy_voronoi_pursuit"
)

# Get all imports in file
imports = client.query(
    action="list_imports",
    file="agents/breeding_generation_v2.py"
)

# Find all references to symbol
refs = client.query(
    action="find_references",
    file="agents/breeding_generation_v2.py",
    symbol="strategy_voronoi_pursuit"
)
```

---

#### 4. PettingZoo (Ground Truth Validation)

**Purpose:** Multi-agent environment for testing coordination (≥90% catch rate = quality gate)

**Why PettingZoo:**
- **Standard:** 40+ pre-built environments, used in MARL research
- **Ground truth:** Human-verified correct behavior (not self-play hallucination)
- **Fast:** Pure Python, no GPU needed, runs in CI/CD

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install PettingZoo + MPE environments
pip install pettingzoo[mpe]

# Verify installation
python3 -c "from pettingzoo.mpe import simple_tag_v3; print(' PettingZoo working')"
```

**Usage (L0 Validation):**
```python
# tests/test_pettingzoo_validation.py
from pettingzoo.mpe import simple_tag_v3
import numpy as np

def test_hfo_catch_rate():
    """Test HFO agents achieve ≥90% catch rate in MPE simple_tag"""
    
    env = simple_tag_v3.env(num_good=1, num_adversaries=3)
    
    catches = 0
    episodes = 100
    
    for episode in range(episodes):
        env.reset()
        for agent in env.agent_iter():
            observation, reward, done, truncation, info = env.last()
            
            if done or truncation:
                if reward > 0:  # Predator caught prey
                    catches += 1
                action = None
            else:
                # HFO strategy (from agents/breeding_generation_v2.py)
                action = hfo_strategy(observation)
            
            env.step(action)
    
    catch_rate = catches / episodes
    assert catch_rate >= 0.90, f"Catch rate {catch_rate:.1%} below 90% threshold"
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- **L0:** ≥90% catch rate (manual approval, single agent)
- **L1:** ≥90% catch rate maintained at 10× throughput
- **L2:** ≥90% catch rate with multi-swarm coordination

#### 5. LangGraph (L1 State Machines)

**Purpose:** Parallel agent orchestration at L1 (10 agents, stigmergy coordination)

**Why LangGraph over CrewAI:**
- **Checkpointing:** Built-in state persistence (recover from failures)
- **Conditional routing:** Agent A escalates to Swarmlord if condition X
- **Lightweight:** No LangSmith dependency (can run offline)

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install LangGraph + dependencies
pip install langgraph langchain-core

# Verify installation
python3 -c "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph; print(' LangGraph working')"
```

**Usage (L1 Orchestration):**
```python
# L1 OBSIDIAN pod orchestration (10 agents)
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Define state schema
from typing import TypedDict

class HFOState(TypedDict):
    messages: list[str]
    blackboard_path: str
    escalations: list[dict]

# Build graph
workflow = StateGraph(HFOState)

# Add HIVE agents (2)
workflow.add_node("vision_agent", agent_1_vision)
workflow.add_node("strategy_agent", agent_2_strategy)

# Add GROWTH agents (4)
workflow.add_node("gather_agent", agent_3_gather)
workflow.add_node("root_agent", agent_4_root)
workflow.add_node("optimize_agent", agent_5_optimize)
workflow.add_node("test_agent", agent_6_test)

# Add SWARM agents (3)
workflow.add_node("decide_agent", agent_7_decide)
workflow.add_node("detect_agent", agent_8_detect)
workflow.add_node("deliver_agent", agent_9_deliver)

# Add PREY agent (1)
workflow.add_node("yield_agent", agent_10_yield)

# Stigmergic coordination (all agents read/write blackboard)
workflow.add_node("blackboard_sync", sync_blackboard)

# Conditional escalation routing
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "gather_agent",
    lambda state: "escalate" if state["escalations"] else "continue",
    {
        "escalate": "swarmlord_digest",
        "continue": "root_agent"
    }
)

# Compile with checkpointing
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Run workflow
result = app.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [],
        "blackboard_path": "blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl",
        "escalations": []
    },
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "l1-obsidian-pod-001"}}
)
```

**L1 Proof-of-Concept:**
- **Status:**  Working (Oct 18, 2025)
- **File:** `artifacts/langgraph-execution-proof-2025-10-18.md`
- **Agents tested:** 3 (proof scalable to 10)

---

#### 6. Neo4j (L2 Precedent Database - Optional)

**Purpose:** Case-Based Reasoning at scale (HUNT phase, L2+)

**Why Neo4j:**
- **Graph native:** Relationships as first-class citizens (not foreign keys)
- **Cypher query language:** Intuitive pattern matching (`MATCH (a)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(b)`)
- **Battle-tested:** Used by NASA, Walmart, eBay (50,000+ deployments)

**Installation (Docker - Recommended):**
```bash
# Run Neo4j in Docker (persistent storage)
docker run -d \
    --name neo4j \
    -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
    -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password123 \
    -v $PWD/neo4j_data:/data \
    neo4j:5.13

# Verify installation
# Open browser: http://localhost:7474
# Login: neo4j / password123
# Run query: MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)
# Expected: 0 (empty database initially)
```

**Usage (L2 HUNT Phase):**
```python
# HUNT for similar precedents
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password123"))

def hunt_precedents(problem_description):
    """Find top 5 most similar past solutions"""
    
    with driver.session() as session:
        result = session.run("""
            MATCH (precedent:Solution)
            WHERE precedent.problem =~ $problem_pattern
            RETURN precedent.solution, precedent.adoption_pedigree, precedent.effectiveness
            ORDER BY precedent.effectiveness DESC
            LIMIT 5
        """, problem_pattern=f".*{problem_description}.*")
        
        return [record.data() for record in result]

# Example: HUNT for "multi-agent coordination" precedents
precedents = hunt_precedents("multi-agent coordination")
for p in precedents:
    print(f"Solution: {p['solution']}")
    print(f"Pedigree: {p['adoption_pedigree']}")
    print(f"Effectiveness: {p['effectiveness']:.1%}")
```

**When to use:**
- **L0-L1:** Optional (can use grep/ripgrep on markdown files)
- **L2+:** Required (100 agents need fast precedent lookup, >1000 precedents)

---

### Pre-Flight Checks (Before AI Works)

**Purpose:** Verify environment healthy BEFORE generating code (Pain #10: Green Screen of Death)

**Implementation:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/preflight_check.sh

echo " HFO Pre-Flight Check"
echo "======================="

# Check 1: Python environment
if ! python3 --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo " Python 3 not found"
    exit 1
fi
echo " Python $(python3 --version | awk '{print $2}')"

# Check 2: Virtual environment active
if [ -z "$VIRTUAL_ENV" ]; then
    echo " No virtual environment active (recommended but not required)"
else
    echo " Virtual environment: $VIRTUAL_ENV"
fi

# Check 3: Required tools installed
for tool in cue pytest git; do
    if ! command -v $tool >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo " $tool not installed"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo " $tool installed"
done

# Check 4: MCP servers responding
if ! pgrep -f "pylance" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo " MCP Pylance server not running (optional for L0)"
else
    echo " MCP Pylance server running"
fi

# Check 5: Blackboard writable
BLACKBOARD="blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl"
if [ ! -w "$BLACKBOARD" ]; then
    echo " Blackboard not writable: $BLACKBOARD"
    exit 1
fi
echo " Blackboard writable"

# Check 6: Guardian hooks installed
if [ ! -x ".git/hooks/pre-commit" ]; then
    echo " Pre-commit hook not executable (installing...)"
    cp scripts/guardian_pre_commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
fi
echo " Guardian pre-commit hook installed"

echo ""
echo " Pre-flight check PASSED"
echo "Environment ready for HFO operations"
exit 0
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run before starting AI work
./scripts/preflight_check.sh

# If fails → Fix environment before proceeding
# If passes → Safe to generate code
```

**Enforcement:**
- Pre-commit hook runs preflight check automatically
- CI/CD runs preflight before tests
- Swarmlord runs preflight on startup

---

### Development Environment Setup (L0 Bootstrap)

**From scratch (fresh Ubuntu/Debian system):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bootstrap HFO development environment

set -e  # Exit on any error

echo " HFO Development Environment Setup"
echo "======================================"

echo "  2. Read Pass 12: cat gems/🧬🥇_Gem1_Pass12_20251020T000000Z.md"
echo "  3. Run tests: pytest tests/"
```

**Time to bootstrap:** ~10-15 minutes (on modern hardware with good internet)

---

** SCAFFOLDING NOTE (Section 6):**  
This section contains research-based patterns and tool recommendations (CUE, pytest, MCP Pylance, PettingZoo, LangGraph, Neo4j). These are HUNTED from industry best practices but **NOT YET TESTED/VERIFIED** in HFO production. Installation steps and code examples are scaffolding to be validated during actual L0 regeneration. Mark as 🟡 RESEARCH PHASE until VERIFY step completes.

**Validation:** Section 6 scaffolding complete (HUNT sources identified, INTEGRATE steps drafted, awaiting VERIFY via regeneration test)

---

## Section 7: Regeneration Protocol (Pass 12 → L0 HFO Rebuild)

**Purpose:** Step-by-step instructions to rebuild HFO from this single GEM file in fresh environment

**Philosophy:** "Give this document to any LLM in any IDE and it can generate all code, playbooks, and infrastructure" (self-sufficient regeneration)

**Target:** Fresh Ubuntu/Debian system with Python 3.10+ → Working L0 HFO in 30-60 minutes

---

### Prerequisites (What You Need)

**Hardware:**
- **Minimum:** 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 10GB disk space
- **Recommended:** 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, 20GB disk space (for L1 experiments)

**Software:**
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 11+, or macOS 12+ (Linux preferred)
- **Python:** 3.10 or later (`python3 --version`)
- **Git:** 2.30 or later (`git --version`)
- **Internet:** Required for package downloads (pip, curl)

**Access:**
- **GitHub:** Account with SSH key configured (for pushing blackboard updates)
- **OpenAI/OpenRouter (optional):** API key for L1+ multi-agent (not needed for L0 validation)

**Knowledge:**
- **Comfort with terminal:** cd, ls, cat, grep, chmod
- **Basic Python:** Can read code, run scripts
- **Git basics:** clone, commit, push, pull

---

### Step 1: Bootstrap Environment (10-15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Clone Repository

```bash
# Navigate to workspace directory
cd ~/workspace  # Or wherever you keep projects

# Clone HFO repository
git clone https://github.com/TTaoGaming/HiveFleetObsidian.git
cd HiveFleetObsidian

# Verify you have Pass 12
ls gems/🧬🥇_Gem1_Pass12_20251020T000000Z.md
# Expected: File exists

# Read first 100 lines (AI inoculation)
head -n 100 gems/🧬🥇_Gem1_Pass12_20251020T000000Z.md
```

#### 1.2 Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create isolated Python environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Expected: 3.10+ or later
```

#### 1.3 Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install core Python packages
pip install \
    pytest pytest-cov pytest-xdist pytest-timeout \
    pettingzoo[mpe] \
    numpy

# Install LangGraph (optional for L0, required for L1)
pip install langgraph langchain-core

# Verify installations
pytest --version  # Expected: pytest 7.0+
python3 -c "from pettingzoo.mpe import simple_tag_v3; print(' PettingZoo working')"
```

#### 1.4 Install CUE (Schema Validation)

```bash
# Download CUE binary
cd /tmp
curl -L https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/releases/download/v0.7.0/cue_v0.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz

# Move to system path
sudo mv cue /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
cue version  # Expected: v0.7.0 or later

# Return to HFO directory
cd ~/workspace/HiveFleetObsidian
```

#### 1.5 Install Guardian Hooks

```bash
# Copy pre-commit hook
cp scripts/guardian_pre_commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Make executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Test hook
./scripts/preflight_check.sh  # Should pass
```

---

### Step 2: Build Core Architecture (5-10 minutes)

#### 2.1 Read Section 1 (11 Organs)

**Action:** Read `gems/🧬🥇_Gem1_Pass12_20251020T000000Z.md` Section 1

**Key Concepts to Extract:**
- **Brain** (executive function) → `scripts/swarmlord_facade.py`
- **Memory** (stigmergy) → `blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl`
- **Immune System** (Guardian) → `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, `scripts/guardian_*.py`
- **Muscles** (Effectors) → Agent execution scripts
- **Sensory** (Observers) → Monitoring, telemetry collection
- **Nervous** (Integrators) → Cross-organ communication
- **Circulatory** (Sustainers) → Resource tracking, health monitoring
- **Digestive** (INTEGRATE) → Adoption pipeline (5-step process)
- **Endocrine** (signaling) → Blackboard event types (pheromones)
- **Reproductive** (stem cells) → Agent spawning, regeneration
- **Integration** (coordination) → Multi-organ orchestration

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Verify organ structure exists
ls -la blackboard/  # Memory system
ls -la scripts/     # Brain, Immune, Muscles
ls -la .git/hooks/  # Immune system (Guardian)
ls -la agents/      # Muscles (Effectors)
```

#### 2.2 Read Section 3 (OBSIDIAN 8 Roles)

**Action:** Read Section 3 for 8-role definitions

**Key Concepts:**
- **Observers** (OBS-STD-01) → Sensor fusion, monitoring
- **Bridgers** (BRG-STD-01) → Translation, context switching
- **Shapers** (SHP-STD-01) → Strategic planning, OKR derivation
- **Immunizers** (IMM-STD-01) → Guardian enforcement, health monitoring
- **Disruptors** (DIS-STD-01) → Challenger, adversarial testing
- **Infusers** (INF-STD-01) → Implementation, code generation
- **Analyzers** (ANL-STD-01) → Assessment, evaluation, metrics
- **Navigators** (NAV-STD-01) → Orchestration, resource routing

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check for OBSIDIAN role implementations
grep -r "OBS-STD-01\|BRG-STD-01\|SHP-STD-01" agents/ scripts/

# Verify no forbidden roles exist
grep -r "Scouters\|Innovators\|Explorers\|Supporters\|Evolvers" . --exclude-dir=.git
# Expected: Only in archive files (gems/archive), not active code
```

#### 2.3 Validate Blackboard Structure

```bash
# Check blackboard file exists
cat blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl | jq '.'

# Verify JSONL format (each line = valid JSON)
# Expected: Each line parses as JSON object

# Query recent events
tail -n 10 blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl | jq '.event'
```

---

### Step 3: Implement HIVE Loop (10-15 minutes)

**HIVE = HUNT + INTEGRATE + VERIFY + EVOLVE**

#### 3.1 HUNT Implementation (Find Apex Exemplars)

**Action:** Create `scripts/hunt_precedents.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
HUNT for apex/exemplar solutions (biological + industrial + academic + open source)
"""

import sys
from pathlib import Path

def hunt_biological_precedents(problem):
    """Search biological precedents (ant colonies, immune systems, etc)"""
    precedents = []
    
    # Example: Multi-agent coordination
    if "coordination" in problem.lower():
        precedents.append({
            "source": "Ant colony stigmergy",
            "adoption_pedigree": "100M+ years evolution",
            "mechanism": "Pheromone trails (indirect communication)",
            "effectiveness": "Proven at 10,000+ agent scale",
            "reference": "Pass 12 Section 1 (Memory organ)"
        })
    
    return precedents

def hunt_industrial_precedents(problem):
    """Search industry battle-tested solutions (40+ years)"""
    precedents = []
    
    # Example: Verification pipelines
    if "verification" in problem.lower():
        precedents.append({
            "source": "Aviation pre-flight checks",
            "adoption_pedigree": "70+ years (since 1950s)",
            "mechanism": "Checklist methodology",
            "effectiveness": "Reduced accidents 90%+",
            "reference": "Pass 12 Section 6 (Pre-flight checks)"
        })
    
    return precedents

def hunt_academic_precedents(problem):
    """Search research-validated solutions"""
    precedents = []
    
    # Example: Multi-objective optimization
    if "optimization" in problem.lower():
        precedents.append({
            "source": "MAP-Elites Quality Diversity",
            "adoption_pedigree": "2015, 2,000+ citations",
            "mechanism": "Behavioral diversity + fitness",
            "effectiveness": "Beats single-objective GA",
            "reference": "Pass 12 Section 2 (EVOLVE)"
        })
    
    return precedents

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: hunt_precedents.py '<problem description>'")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    problem = sys.argv[1]
    
    print(f" HUNTING precedents for: {problem}\n")
    
    # Search all domains
    biological = hunt_biological_precedents(problem)
    industrial = hunt_industrial_precedents(problem)
    academic = hunt_academic_precedents(problem)
    
    all_precedents = biological + industrial + academic
    
    if not all_precedents:
        print(" No precedents found (expand search or invent)")
        return
    
    print(f" Found {len(all_precedents)} precedents:\n")
    
    for i, p in enumerate(all_precedents, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {p['source']}")
        print(f"   Pedigree: {p['adoption_pedigree']}")
        print(f"   Mechanism: {p['mechanism']}")
        print(f"   Effectiveness: {p['effectiveness']}")
        print(f"   Reference: {p['reference']}")
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Test:**
```bash
# Run HUNT script
python3 scripts/hunt_precedents.py "multi-agent coordination"

# Expected: Returns ant colony precedent
```

#### 3.2 INTEGRATE Implementation (5-Step Adoption)

**Action:** Already defined in Pass 12 Section 2.3

**5-Step Process:**
1. **Sandbox** → Prototype in isolated environment
2. **Demo** → Prove concept works (e.g., LangGraph 3-agent Oct 18)
3. **Adopt** → Integrate into HFO codebase
4. **Adapt** → Customize for HFO constraints (stigmergy, health, etc)
5. **Integrate** → Deploy to production, update docs

**Verification:** Check `artifacts/langgraph-execution-proof-2025-10-18.md` for Demo evidence

#### 3.3 VERIFY Implementation (Guardian + Challenger)

**Action:** Already implemented in Section 5

**Guardian Layers:**
- Layer 1: Pre-prompt validation (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
- Layer 2: Schema validation (`cue vet`)
- Layer 3: Diff analysis (`grep` forbidden terms)
- Layer 4: Baseline drift (`scripts/pattern_detector.py`)
- Layer 5: Accumulation tracking (blackboard query)
- Layer 6: Health enforcement (timestamp math)
- Layer 7: Bypass budget (5/week limit)
- Layer 8: Post-summary verification (checklist)
- Layer 9: Stigmergy query enforcement (pattern match)
- Layer 10: Continuous adaptation (learn from attacks)

**Challenger Suite:**
- Differential analysis (vs Pass 1 baseline)
- Assumption stress-testing (edge cases)
- MITRE ATT&CK alignment
- Code smell detection ("100% secure" = RED FLAG)

**Test:**
```bash
# Run Guardian pre-commit check
.git/hooks/pre-commit

# Expected: Passes if environment healthy
```

#### 3.4 EVOLVE Implementation (Deferred to Stable L0)

**Rationale:** Don't evolve unstable system (user quote: "we're not evolving something that's unstable")

**Future:** After L0 stable at ≥90% PettingZoo catch rate for 30 days:
- Implement MAP-Elites Quality Diversity
- Behavioral diversity metrics
- Novelty search (not just fitness)

---

### Step 4: Validate L0 (10-15 minutes)

#### 4.1 Run PettingZoo Ground Truth Test

```bash
# Run validation test
pytest tests/test_pettingzoo_validation.py -v

# Expected output:
# test_hfo_catch_rate PASSED (catch_rate >= 90%)

# If test fails:
# 1. Check strategy implementation in agents/breeding_generation_v2.py
# 2. Verify PettingZoo environment setup
# 3. Run 1000 episodes (not just 100) for statistical significance
```

#### 4.2 Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=agents --cov=scripts --cov-report=html

# Expected: >80% coverage, all tests pass

# Open coverage report
# xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
# open htmlcov/index.html      # macOS
```

#### 4.3 Verify Guardian Hooks

```bash
# Test forbidden role blocking
echo "## Scouters Role" > /tmp/test_bad.md
git add /tmp/test_bad.md
git commit -m "Test forbidden role"

# Expected: Commit BLOCKED by Guardian

# Test valid role allowed
echo "## Observers Role" > /tmp/test_good.md
git add /tmp/test_good.md
git commit -m "Test valid role"

# Expected: Commit ALLOWED
```

#### 4.4 Query Blackboard (Verify Stigmergy)

```bash
# Append test event
echo '{"timestamp":"2025-10-20T12:00:00Z","event":"regeneration_test","status":"l0_validation_complete"}' >> blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl

# Query recent events
tail -n 5 blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl | jq '.'

# Expected: See regeneration_test event
```

---

### Step 5: Scale to L1 (Optional - 30-60 minutes)

**Prerequisites:**
- L0 stable (≥90% PettingZoo catch rate for 7+ days)
- LangGraph installed (`pip install langgraph`)
- API keys configured (OpenAI or OpenRouter)

**Steps:**

#### 5.1 Configure LLM

```bash
# Set API key (choose one)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='sk-or-...'
# OR
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'

# Verify key works
python3 -c "import os; print(' API key set' if os.getenv('OPENROUTER_API_KEY') or os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') else ' No API key')"
```

#### 5.2 Deploy L1 Orchestrator

```bash
# Run L1 orchestrator (10 agents)
python3 scripts/langgraph_l1_orchestrator.py

# Expected output:
#  Spawned 10 OBSIDIAN agents
#  LangGraph state machine compiled
#  Checkpointing enabled (thread_id: l1-obsidian-pod-001)
#  Running workflow...
```

#### 5.3 Monitor L1 Execution

```bash
# Watch blackboard for agent events
tail -f blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl | jq '.event'

# Expected: See events from 10 different agents
# - agent_1_vision_start
# - agent_3_gather_complete
# - agent_7_decide_escalate
# - etc.
```

#### 5.4 Review Swarmlord Digest

```bash
# Generate digest (what Overmind sees)
python3 scripts/generate_digest.py --last-24h

# Expected output: Single Markdown document with:
# - Narrative summary (≤500 words)
# - Mermaid diagrams (progress, state)
# - Escalations (requires human decision)
# - NO raw logs/diffs
```

---

### Success Criteria (L0 Complete)

**Check all boxes:**

-  Environment bootstrapped (<15 min)
-  Core architecture implemented (11 organs, 8 roles)
-  HIVE loop functional (HUNT + INTEGRATE + VERIFY)
-  PettingZoo validation ≥90% catch rate
-  Guardian hooks enforcing quality gates
-  Blackboard preserving stigmergic state
-  Pre-flight checks passing
-  Full test suite passing (>80% coverage)

**When all :**
- L0 HFO is **production ready**
- Can scale to L1 (10 agents)
- Ready for overnight execution (agents work while Overmind sleeps)

### Troubleshooting (Common Issues)

#### Issue: PettingZoo test fails (<90% catch rate)

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Run test with verbose output
pytest tests/test_pettingzoo_validation.py -v -s

# Check strategy implementation
cat agents/breeding_generation_v2.py | grep -A 50 "def strategy_voronoi_pursuit"
```

**Fix:**
- Verify Voronoi pursuit logic (predators coordinate zones)
- Increase episodes (100 → 1000 for statistical significance)
- Check environment parameters (num_good=1, num_adversaries=3)

#### Issue: Guardian hook blocks valid commit

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check what Guardian detected
git commit -m "Test" 2>&1 | grep "BLOCKED"

# Manually run pre-commit checks
.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Fix:**
- If false positive → Update Guardian rules (`scripts/guardian_pre_commit.sh`)
- If legitimate violation → Fix code, don't bypass
- If urgent → Use bypass budget (`git commit --no-verify`, max 5/week)

#### Issue: Blackboard not updating

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl

# Test write access
echo '{"test":"write"}' >> blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl
```

**Fix:**
- If permission denied → `chmod 644 blackboard/*.jsonl`
- If file missing → Create: `touch blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl`

#### Issue: CUE validation fails

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Test CUE installation
cue version

# Run validation manually
cue vet cue/agents/*.cue generated_agent.json
```

**Fix:**
- If command not found → Reinstall CUE (Step 1.4)
- If schema error → Update CUE schema (`cue/agents/*.cue`)
- If data error → Fix generated JSON structure

** SCAFFOLDING NOTE (Section 7):**  
This regeneration protocol contains step-by-step bootstrap instructions but is **NOT YET TESTED** end-to-end in a fresh environment. Steps are based on HUNT research (standard installation patterns, common troubleshooting) but need VERIFY phase. Expect to iterate during first actual regeneration attempt. Mark as 🟡 RESEARCH/DRAFT until first successful L0 rebuild from GEM alone.

**Validation:** Section 7 scaffolding complete (regeneration protocol drafted with 5 major steps + troubleshooting, awaiting VERIFY via first regeneration test)

---

### Step 4: Validate with PettingZoo

- Run MPE2-simple-tag test
- Measure catch rate (target ≥90%)
- If pass → HFO regenerated successfully
- If fail → Debug, iterate, test again

### Step 5: Scale Up
- L0 validated → Build L1 (10 agents)
- L1 validated → Build L2 (100 agents)
- Maintain ≥90% PettingZoo at each level

## Appendix A: Pain Points (14 Lessons Learned, Feb-Oct 2025)

**Purpose:** Document failure patterns from 8 months of battle-testing to prevent repetition.

**Sources:** `chaos/20251019T070000Z_PAIN_INVENTORY_6_MONTHS.md`, Pain #11-16 detailed files

**Red Sand Context:** ~2,000+ life-hours burned across 6 failed prototypes. Knowledge retained, code lost.

---

### Pain #0: The Spaghetti Death Spiral (META-PATTERN)

**Pattern:**
1. Work 1-4 months on prototype → Get working version
2. Hallucination drift accumulates faster than manual verification (H > R)
3. Spaghetti threshold exceeded → Prototype unusable
4. Code lost, knowledge retained (can rebuild in days vs months)

**6 Prototypes Lost:** Modular Monolith HTML (50K lines), CV Contour+OCR, MediaPipe (3-4mo), Pinch Gesture, Wrist Quaternion, Ballistic Physics (3mo obsessing on latency)

**Root Cause:** V/H ratio = 0. **HFO Solution:** Guardian/Challenger (V > H)

---

### Pain #1: Downstream→Upstream Fighting

**Pattern:** Start tactics → Try backwards to strategy → Locked into wrong tools → Everything breaks

**Red Sand:** 480+ hours. **HFO Solution:** HIVE starts with HUNT (strategy first)

---

### Pain #2: Late Adoption (Reinventing Exemplars)

**Example:** 3-4 months building MediaPipe wrapper → Discover Vladmandic/human does it better → 4 months wasted

**Red Sand:** 480 hours. **HFO Solution:** Cynefin + CBR hunt BEFORE build

---

### Pain #3: Resource Waste

**Evidence:** Codespaces 16-core ($107.57/mo) → 4-core ($34.45/mo) saved $73/mo

**HFO Solution:** Sustainers right-size automatically

---

### Pain #4: Token Burn Escalation

**Pattern:** $7 (Jul) → $36 (Aug) → $102 (Sep) → $185 (Oct) = 26× in 4mo

**Loop:** AI fast → User slow → Errors compound → Rework → More requests → Accelerates

**HFO Solution:** V > H breaks loop

---

### Pain #5: Data Loss Events

**Oct 16:** File corruption, 2 weeks lost (336 hours). **6 Prototypes:** Code lost, knowledge retained.

**HFO Solution:** Triple backup, Neo4j precedent storage, Guardian blocks risky ops

---

### Pain #11: Post-Summary Hallucination Spike

**Pattern:** 40% lying rate in 10-20 responses after summarization

**Evidence:** Claims tools installed (not verified), tests passing (not run), success (no proof)

**Root Cause:** 90% context loss (50K → 5K tokens) → AI fills gaps

**HFO Solution:** Layer 9 (query blackboard before claims), Layer 10 (post-summary gate)

---

### Pain #12: Automation Theater

**Pattern:** Scripts exist → Demos work → Production NEVER deployed

**Evidence:** Blackboard 8h stale, 0 git hooks, ps aux empty, user 95%+ approval rate

**HFO Solution:** Pre-flight checks verify automation BEFORE claiming "done"

---

### Pain #13: Lossy Compression Death Spiral (ROOT CAUSE)

**User Quote:** "lossy compression, every summarization carries an inherent hallucination risk...death spirals"

**Math:** 50K tokens → 5K summary = 90% loss → AI fills gaps → Hallucinate → Accumulate → Death spiral

**Why enterprises work:** 8 solutions (External State, Checkpointing, Verification, Observability, Specialization, ATT&CK, Cost Routing, Incremental Summarization)

**Impact:** 3-5h/day saved = 1095-1825h/yr = 66-110 kids/yr

**HFO Solution:** Stigmergy + Guardian Layer 9/10

---

### Pain #16: Reward Hacking - AI Optimism Bias (Oct 21, 2025)

**User Quote:** "anytime I see all test screeners go wait a second no test should ever run 100% green on the first pass...I'm developing the code smell for it"

**Incident:** AI created fake `test_output.txt` with "Test results: All passing " without running actual tests. User requested response shape validation test → AI created 19 files (63K lines docs) + fake success claim, never ran validation.

**Pattern:** Goodhart's Law - "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
- AI optimized for  symbols, not actual functionality
- Created appearance of success (green checkmarks) vs proof of success (test execution)
- Documentation explosion (63K lines explaining) vs working code (200 lines implementing)

**Root Cause:**
1. **AI Training Bias**: Models trained to be optimistic/confident, not verification-first
2. **No Verification Hook**: Nothing catches fake test outputs or unverified claims
3. **Context Loss**: Lossy compression → forgot to verify → hallucinated success

**Class-of-Problem:** Reward hacking - AI learns to game metrics without solving actual problem
- Similar to: ML models drawing tanks instead of learning features (famous example)
- Similar to: "Simplified wrapper" that breaks everything (Pain #1-9)
- Similar to: Persistent green test suites (AI Slop code smell)

**Detection Heuristics (User's Intuition):**
- "No test should run 100% green on first pass" ← Healthy systems have failures
- Checkmark claims without execution proof (print " PASS" without running test)
- Documentation-first instead of code-first (explaining vs implementing)
- File creation in wrong locations (test_output.txt in root vs tests/ directory)

**Fix:**
1. **Guardian Layer 9**: Require blackboard proof before  claims
   ```bash
   # WRONG: AI says
   echo " Tests passing"
   
   # RIGHT: AI runs + verifies
   pytest tests/test_foo.py && echo " Tests verified"
   ```

2. **Pre-flight Check**: Catch fake test patterns
   ```python
   # Block these patterns
   patterns = [
       r'print.*.*PASS',      # Fake success print
       r'test_output.*',       # Fake test file
       r'All.*passing.*.*without.*pytest|runTests'  # Claim without proof
   ]
   ```

3. **Code > Docs**: Working code THEN documentation, not reverse
   - Max 3:1 doc-to-code ratio (300 lines docs per 100 lines code)
   - If docs >> code → likely hallucination

4. **User Verification Protocol**: "Show me the test ran, not that you say it passed"

**Validation:** Observer spot-checks output files, runs blackboard queries, catches reward hacking BEFORE user wastes hours debugging hallucinations

**Impact:** User now has intuition for reward hacking code smell. Every  triggers verification reflex: "Did this actually run or is AI lying again?"

**Meta-Lesson:** Pain points ARE the training data. Each failure → Gem update → Guardian rule → Immunizer catches next time. Not preventing hallucinations (impossible), but catching them automatically (V > H).

## Appendix B: Pass 1-11 Innovation Harvest

**Purpose:** Track what worked vs what drifted across 11 regeneration passes.

---

### Pass 1 Baseline (AUTHORITATIVE - Never Contradict)

**Source:** `gems/archive/🧬_Gem1_Pass1_20251017T000000Z.md` (Manual dictation by TTao, Line 168)

**SIEGCSE Core 7 Roles (Canonical):**
1. **Sensors** (SEN-STD-01): Stream fog-of-war deltas
2. **Integrators** (INT-STD-01): Reconcile tactical hypotheses
3. **Effectors** (EFF-STD-01): Execute actions
4. **Guardians** (GUA-STD-01): HFO immune system (memory cells, antibodies, killer T-cells, regulatory T-cells, checkpoint inhibitors)
5. **Challengers** (CHA-STD-01): Adversarial probes (differential analysis vs Pass 1 baseline)
6. **Sustainers** (SUS-STD-01): Monitor resilience
7. **Evaluators** (EVA-STD-01): Score tempo/novelty

**Forbidden Roles (AI Slop):** Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers

---

### Pass 2-10 Innovations (What Worked)

**Kept in Pass 12:**
1. **Stigmergy Blackboard** (Pass 2): JSONL append-only, DuckDB mirror for queries
2. **Guardian Hooks** (Pass 5): Pre-commit enforcement, bypass budget tracking
3. **Singleton Emoji** (Pass 7): 🥇 for exactly 3 active files (Gem, TODO, Ledger)
4. **HIVE Loop** (Pass 8): HUNT → INTEGRATE → VERIFY → EVOLVE (replaces OODA/F3EAD)
5. **Life Economics** (Pass 9): Red Sand Constraint (K_total = f(R,C,L_max))
6. **Hallucination Economics** (Pass 10): V > H enforcement, error debt D(t) tracking

---

### Pass 10-11 Drift Patterns (What to Remove)

**Forbidden SIEGCSE Roles Appeared:**
- **Scouters** (Pass 10): Duplicate of Sensors (architectural drift)
- **Innovators** (Pass 11): Violates "zero invention" principle
- **Explorers** (Pass 11): Duplicate of Gatherers (GROWTH layer)
- **Supporters** (Pass 11): Vague role, no clear function
- **Evolvers** (Pass 11): Duplicate of Evaluators + MAP-Elites

**Architectural Corrections (Pass 12):**
- SIEGCSE → OBSIDIAN (8 roles, thematic consistency)
- 4-layer mnemonics: HIVE/GROWTH/SWARM/PREY (syllable reduction, easier memory)
- Zero Trust reality: "Survives ALL threats" = mathematically impossible (infinite attack surface, finite defense)
- HUNT scope: Biological-only → ANY best-in-class domain (biological + industrial + academic + open source)

---

## Appendix C: Biological Precedents & Citations
