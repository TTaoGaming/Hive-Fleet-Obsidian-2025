# Hive Fleet Obsidian ‚Äî Gem 1 Generation 4 Summary

## Key Concepts
Generation 4 (Pass 4) of Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) refines lvl0 operations by establishing a single source of truth (SSOT) through the active gem pointer (`gems/ACTIVE_GEM1.md`), neutralizing AI-generated drift ("slop") and formalizing daily rituals with guardrails. Core concepts include:

- **Gem Stewardship:** The gem as the canonical, mutable facade; prior passes archived immutably in `gems/archive/`. This enforces "gem-first" edits, where Overmind requests changes via Swarmlord, preventing rogue modifications.
- **Stigmergy Ledger:** Append-only `blackboard/obsidian_synapse_blackboard.jsonl` mirrored in DuckDB for parity, logging events like `Gem1-Pass4` transitions. Supports traceability for SIEGCSE roles (Sensors, Integrators, Effectors, Guardians, Challengers, Sustainers, Evaluators).
- **Holonic Solo Coverage:** Lvl0 operates as a single agent (Swarmlord) rotating SIEGCSE hats, annotated in action meshes (e.g., `[Holonic Solo ‚Üí Sensor]`). Daily rituals follow a 5-pass cadence: Intent ‚Üí Clarify ‚Üí Audit ‚Üí Optimize ‚Üí Finalize, timeboxed to 20 minutes.
- **Guardrails & Automation:** Pre-commit hooks (`scripts/run_guardrails.sh`) validate pointer alignment, lint diagrams (‚â•3 per gem), and enforce compliance. Zero-trust reminders: non-gem edits require blackboard justification.
- **Visualization & Metrics:** Mermaid diagrams (bring-up flow, artifact mesh, ritual timeline) and lvl0 success metrics (ritual completion rate, guardrail alerts, ledger freshness) baseline operations.

Risk posture is üü° (caution), with pheromone color signaling stabilization post-drift cleanup. North Star: Lock lvl0 (gems, CUE, templates, blackboard) before scaling.

## Evolutions from Prior Generations
Gen_4 evolves from Gen_1-3's foundational doctrine (Pass 1: core identity, facets; Pass 2: daily rituals; Pass 3: blackboard/compliance). 

- **From Gen_1 (Pass 1):** Builds on swarm persona (Swarmlord facade) and facets (e.g., SWARM loop, GROWTH pipeline), but introduces pointer discipline to resolve multi-surface drift absent in early passes.
- **From Gen_2 (Pass 2):** Formalizes rituals (5-pass cadence) noted in Pass 2, adding holonic annotations and template enhancements (`templates/daily_todo_pass_workflow.md`) for SIEGCSE tracking.
- **From Gen_3 (Pass 3):** Directly archives Pass 3, integrating Obsidian Synapse blackboard schema (`timestamp`, `pass`, `role`, `event`) and compliance rails (git hooks, CI). Evolves lvl0 solo coverage by wiring ledger scaffolding.

Fan-out: Expands Gen_1's log-10 ladder (lvl0 solo ‚Üí lvl1 pods) with specific lvl0 metrics and pre-commit placeholders. Converge: Recenters on SSOT, patching Gen_3's blackboard gaps (e.g., DuckDB mirror stub).

Drift Check: Addresses AI slop (non-canonical stubs) via lint/challenger scripts (`scripts/lint_gem_alignment.py`), logging `event:"drift_cleanup"`. No major hallucinations; refinements focus on pointer enforcement to prevent future drift.

## Connections to HFO Architecture & Lineage
Gen_4 integrates into HFO's biomimetic lineage (ant pheromones, termite ventilation) via stigmergy ledger, connecting to broader gems:

- **To Other Gems:** As Gen_1 lineage, it seeds Gen_5+ evolutions (e.g., automation in Pass 5). Pointer aligns with Gen_19's audit-drift focus, ensuring canonical flow.
- **HFO Integration:** Embeds in cognitive exoskeleton (Facet 1: facade translation; Facet 5: liberation stack prerequisites). Supports war chest (hypercasual flywheel) and harmony campaigns (compassionate debriefs). Lvl0 gates lvl10 constellation (10¬π‚Å∞ actors, triple-signature governance).
- **Lineage Ties:** Evolves Gen_1's fail-better doctrine (Beckett mantra) with drift remediation case studies. Connects to exemplars: NASA flight rules (governance), Atlassian playbooks (rituals), JADC2 (data fusion).

Overall, Gen_4 converges early chaos into stable lvl0, fanning out to scalable HFO via pointer-led SSOT. Word count: 428.
