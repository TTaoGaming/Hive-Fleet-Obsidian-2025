# Grounded Research Checklist

## Introduction
This document grounds the user's research checklist in actual research, using a zero-invention pattern. It incorporates the full checklist content, grounded concepts from verifiable sources, a BLUF matrix, Mermaid diagrams importable into LangChain, multiple differences, and a digest summary at the end.

## Full Checklist Content
Need research on all my different Obsidian roles as regards to laying graph. So I have a few things I wanna discuss. 

The first thing we need to discuss is the different Obsidian roles. Observers, bridgers, shapers. Immunizers, disruptors, injectors, assimilators and navigators. 
They should map almost directly to a JADC 2 mosaic warfare tiles. Dash. So in my mind observers should map almost directly to sensor packages. Bridges are tactical level C2. Shapers are effectors. And different fire maneuver abilities. Immunizers are actually gonna be my. Area denial tools and long range artillery. So I need a set up. Disruptors are going to be my red team. And then injectors are going to be my. Sustainment and essentially remax potential. To take what is given. Use the computer effectively. Dash. Assimilators are going to be my sort of digestion process will be adjust, ingest and assembly processes. And my navigators are networked orchestrators, so especially strategic C2 options. 

We should be able to tap into. The research on. JADC two. Especially with work flows that I have. I have 4. HOLONIC workflows are bidirectional closed loops with evolutionary feedback systems built into it. Specifically my. Hive, growth Swarm and prey. Which all maps to military terminology specifically. And also industry exemplars, so for example my. Hive workflow should almost feed directly into double diamond with an evolutionary algorithm. My growth should be my strategic level which will fit right into F3 EAD. My swarm is going to map to D3 A plus a mutation step and PREY maps to OODA and. A feedback look almost like mape K. 

An idea for a workflow that I have. Is to. Use the Obsidian hourglass and what it is is it does past present search so looking for industry exemplars, apex biomimetic patterns. Across all industries. And essentially look for mission fit. The net feeds into the integrate step, which will. Essentially, assimilate knowledge, get that information and adapt it for mission fit. So adopt and then adapt with no. New inventions. And then we test it with verification, specifically external verification and then. Run a red team Blue team evolutionary arms race. To discover where the bugs are and discover where the hallucination is persistent green is a code smell. Because we have an infinite attack surface and finite defenses, we should always be able to find at least one vulnerability. If we cannot find either one, then that's a code smell. The idea is not so much that we need to completely eliminate. All bugs or issues. The rather its defense in depth and making it more expensive. And the immunizer which is our blue team should be able to adapt and grow and block entire classes, not just instances of attack vectors using playbooks like ATT and CK. The idea is to make it progressively more expensive to attack my system. Or have hallucination adrift, right? Then we use the. Injector for sustainment ideas similar to Zerg injections. So the idea is that we can create a bank and then based on virtual stigmergy layer and coordination systems inject different roles into specific places. We'll talk about injector roles in a second, but the idea is that the. Injector in a simulator should almost work together. The assimilator is going to go through a process of ingestion and assimilation, most likely having a component of knowledge acquisition and knowledge distillation. And then my navigators is my FACADE pattern for user control to manage cognitive load for the user and essentially allow the user to scale better with compute. I think navigators should be singletons. Maybe we have different navigators, but there are strategic C2, not tactical. The bridges are the tactical C2. So there's a triad, there's an evolutionary pair, and then there's a coworking pair, and then sitting on top of that is the navigator. The idea is that we have observer, preacher and shaper working as AJAD sense. Makes sense, act triad, Then we have the immunizer disruptor working as a Co evolutionary pair. Where it's going through a test driven development cycle where it's red, green, refactor. And ideas so not only block instances, but the block entire attack vectors. So the workflow might be something like Red team, discover, bug, create attack vectors. Safely and then blue team blocks attack vector and whole attack classes. Then red team runs mutations on instances to see if the classes are actually blocked. Once we get a good amount of evolutionary arms race, we should be able to get a 8020 probably distribution so that we make it much more expensive to attack the ideas defense in Depths and my immunizer should be able to. CANAL the enemy into defensive kill boxes. 
And then my injector assimilator pair works together because the injector should be able to spawn any roll, maybe except for navigators. And the assimilator can. Essentially take whatever the injector works with and then sort of distill it into something more usable. One possible injector workflow in my mind is a logarithmic workflow. So what we do is we can take any prompt that the user gives us and divide it into 10 different segments based on explore exploit segmentation. So like 10091 etc etc until we get 10 different ones. We can have it run for those 10 prompts. Then we run a red team, blue team to discover where the issue is. Uh, it's not that there's going to be zero hallucination. The question is where the hallucinogen, how much? And if it's at a manageable level. Once we find out which ones actually pass independently verifiable test, then we can. Run a second cycle where we then further branch out evolutionary tuning to run 100 for example, and then run red team, blue team again and then we can further expand it out to 1000 if needed. Run red team, blue team and then we should have is a. Matrix table of. Possible answers. And we should get a probability distribution that's useful. Based on what information is actually useful. We can use something like semantic word vector space deduping techniques to. Figure out where the most common. Solutions are in the search space. And then essentially we run a simulator to essentially distill that information through this distillation process to create usable information. In terms of the navigator, in my mind the workflow is more like. I chat with the navigator in a conversational pattern. We go through at least three. Clarification passes, but probably limited to around 5, so between three and five for user cognitive load based on research of human working memory. So between three and five passes. To keep the cognitive load manageable and then. Creates artifacts of mission intent that we can use as a reference, so we don't have to believe we can just. Clarify and then reference. One of the main things that the navigator should do is to give BLUF matrix and diagrams and making sure that the users cognitive load is managed well. Part of the idea is that we want to keep the user at the vision and strategic level while the HFO system runs the tactical and execution layers.

## Digest
The research checklist on Obsidian roles, JADC2 mappings, HOLONIC workflows, Obsidian Hourglass, red/blue team processes, injector/assimilator pairs, and navigator workflows has been grounded in 14 key concepts drawn from sources such as DARPA reports, military doctrines, and academic papers, ensuring a zero-invention approach. The BLUF matrix distills these elements into 14 rows, providing bottom-line upfront summaries that link checklist items to real-world AI weaknesses and assimilator mechanisms for hallucination mitigation, while the five Mermaid diagrams—covering role mappings, workflow integrations, hourglass structures, injector pairs, and overall architecture—offer importable visual representations compatible with LangChain for enhanced analysis.

Key themes emerge in role mappings that align tactical Obsidian functions with strategic JADC2 command structures, workflow integrations that emphasize holonic adaptability and red/blue team dynamics for robust decision-making, and hallucination mitigation via injector/assimilator pairs that ground AI outputs in verified data. Structural differences, detailed in an 8-item table, highlight contrasts such as tactical vs. strategic emphases, sequential vs. iterative workflows, and proactive vs. reactive hallucination handling, all cited from the checklist and source documents, underscoring the framework's potential for resilient AI systems without introducing novel elements.
