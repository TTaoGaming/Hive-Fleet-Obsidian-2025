# Blackboard Index - 2025-10-25T17:00:00Z

## Overview
The blackboard/ directory serves as a stigmergic shared memory surface for HFO, intended for JSONL event logs (e.g., obsidian_synapse_blackboard.jsonl) and DuckDB mirrors (e.g., obsidian_synapse_blackboard.duckdb). Currently empty as no raw artifacts were identified in sources; serves as placeholder for future dynamic references.

## References
- Derived from Gem doctrine (Pass10+): Append-only JSONL for decisions, mirrored in DuckDB for queries.
- Integration: Scripts in core_scripts/ can populate on activation (e.g., via SWARM/GROWTH loops).
- Next: Populate during lvl1 swarm activation with telemetry from gems/todos.

No files present; 0% redundancy, self-contained for handoff.
