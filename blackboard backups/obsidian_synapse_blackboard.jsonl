Currently empty as no raw artifacts were identified in sources; serves as placeholder for future dynamic references.\n\n## References\n- Derived from Gem doctrine (Pass10+): Append-only JSONL for decisions, mirrored in DuckDB for queries.\n- Integration: Scripts in core_scripts/ can populate on activation (e.g., via SWARM/GROWTH loops).\n- Next: Populate during lvl1 swarm activation with telemetry from gems/todos.\n\nNo files present; 0% redundancy, self-contained for handoff."}
